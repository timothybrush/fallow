# Fallow: codebase intelligence for TypeScript and JavaScript

Fallow is codebase intelligence for TypeScript and JavaScript. The free static layer analyzes code and styles: it finds unused files, exports, dependencies, types, enum members, class members, unresolved imports, unlisted deps, duplicate exports, circular dependencies, boundary violations, code duplication, and complexity hotspots, plus design-system styling drift (CSS and CSS-in-JS) in `fallow audit` and opt-in API hygiene checks such as private type leaks. A paid runtime intelligence layer (Fallow Runtime) adds production execution evidence (hot and cold paths, runtime-backed review, runtime-weighted health, stale-flag evidence, trends, alerts). Rust alternative to [knip](https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip) built on the Oxc parser ecosystem.

For shared domain vocabulary, term definitions, and flagged ambiguities: see @CONTEXT.md. For the feature-workflow chain (when /fallow-implement, /panel-review, /user-panel, /fallow-review are invoked and how the .plans/ artefact threads them together): see @.claude/rules/workflow.md.

## Architecture

Pipeline: Config → File Discovery → Incremental Parallel Parsing (rayon + oxc_parser + oxc_semantic, cache-aware) → Script Analysis → Module Resolution (oxc_resolver) → Graph Construction → Re-export Chain Resolution → Dead Code Detection → Reporting

## Building & Testing

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks  # Enable pre-commit hooks (fmt + clippy)
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace --lib --bins --tests --examples
cargo check --workspace --benches
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo run --bin fallow                       # Run all analyses (dead-code + dupes + health)
cargo run --bin fallow -- watch              # Watch mode
cargo run --bin fallow -- fix --dry-run      # Auto-fix preview
```

## Code conventions

- Config files: `.fallowrc.json` > `.fallowrc.jsonc` > `fallow.toml` > `.fallow.toml`
- No `detect` section in config; use `rules` with `"off"` severity
- No `output` in config; output format is CLI-only via `--format`
- Rules severity: `error` (fail CI, default) | `warn` (exit 0) | `off` (skip)
- Inline suppression: `// fallow-ignore-next-line [issue-type]` and `// fallow-ignore-file [issue-type]`
- Environment variables: `FALLOW_FORMAT`, `FALLOW_QUIET`, `FALLOW_BIN` (binary path for MCP), `FALLOW_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` (extraction cache cap in MB; default 256)
- See `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` for clippy, size assertions, and CI hardening details

## Key design decisions

Documented as Architecture Decision Records in `decisions/` (kept in a private repo, symlinked locally). Key decisions:

- **No TypeScript compiler** (ADR-001): Syntactic analysis via Oxc parser + `oxc_semantic`. No type resolution, no tsc.
- **Flat edge storage** (ADR-002): Contiguous `Vec<Edge>` with range indices for cache-friendly traversal.
- **FxHashMap/FxHashSet required** (ADR-003): Standard `HashMap`/`HashSet` disallowed (enforced via `.clippy.toml`).
- **Path-sorted FileIds** (ADR-004): Stable cross-run identity, not insertion order.
- **Re-export chain resolution** (ADR-005): Iterative propagation through barrel files with cycle detection.
- **Hidden directory allowlist** (ADR-006): `.storybook`, `.vitepress`, `.well-known`, `.changeset`, `.github` traversed; other dotdirs skipped.

## Git conventions

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Signed commits (`git commit -S`)
- No AI attribution in commits

## Project communication

- Never reduce fallow to "dead code tool" in taglines or summaries; reference all 5 analysis areas (unused code, circular deps, duplication, complexity hotspots, boundary violations). Category is "codebase analyzer."
- Comparison pages must be research-backed with source links; never claim a competitor "can't" do something without checking
- Design specs are definitions, not implementations: tokens, rules, components, ASCII wireframes, table-described behavior; no CSS/JS/HTML code blocks

## Repo layout (for this working tree)

- `~/Sites/fallow-2/` is a working copy of fallow main; primary checkout is the bare-config'd `~/Sites/fallow/`
- `.internal/`, `quality/`, `reference/`, `benchmarks/fixtures/`, `benchmarks/knip6/` are gitignored symlinks; `.internal/` points at `~/Sites/fallow-cloud/.internal/` (single source of truth, edit only there); the rest point at `~/Sites/fallow/`
- `npm/fallow/skills/` is a vendored copy of `~/Sites/fallow-skills/`; refresh happens at release time, not manually
- Edit fallow skills in `~/Sites/fallow-skills/fallow/skills/fallow/`, never in the symlinked `~/.agents/skills/fallow/`
- GitHub org: `fallow-rs/fallow` (use `gh ... --repo fallow-rs/fallow`); never `bartwaardenburg/fallow`
- `fallow dead-code` is dead-code only (legacy alias `check` still works); bare `fallow` runs the full pipeline (dead-code + dupes + health)

## Worktree / parallel-agent rules

Multiple agents and background sessions frequently land commits in fallow main concurrently. Treat every working tree as racy:

- **Commit WIP early.** If a feature takes more than ~10 minutes and parallel sessions are active, switch to a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/<name>`) and commit per chunk. Uncommitted state in main does not survive even one parallel `git stash` cycle, especially for untracked files.
- **Verify commit authors before every push.** Run `git log --format="%H %ae %s" <base>..HEAD` and abort if any author is not `bart@waardenburg.dev`, a contributor email, or `...@users.noreply.github.com`. Worktrees and pre-push hooks have leaked `test@example.com` and `test@test.com` commits in the past.
- **Never push fallow commits via fallow-2 (or any worktree) when WIP exists.** Fix the bare-repo push at its root (e.g. unset `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` in `.githooks/pre-push`) or create a fresh ephemeral worktree with `git -C <bare> worktree add /tmp/fallow-push <branch>`.
- **`combined/mod.rs` is the merge-conflict magnet.** `combined.rs` was split into a `combined/` module: `mod.rs` keeps the orchestrator (`run_combined`'s `rayon::join` + shared-parse threading, analysis resolution, health-options wiring), while `output.rs` (format printers + regression/summary), `orientation.rs` (orientation header + entry-point display), and `impact.rs` (impact recording) are independent files editable in parallel. Assign ALL `combined/mod.rs` edits to a single agent that runs after parallel crate-level work finishes; the submodules no longer need serialization.
- **After cherry-picking from worktree agents, always run `cargo fmt --all`.** Worktree agents do not always produce rustfmt-compliant code.
- **After every worktree merge, scan for orphan conflict markers.** `grep -r '<<<<<<' crates/` (already auto-enforced by the conflict-marker-scan PostToolUse hook, but run manually before pushing).
- **After cleaning up worktrees, force-remove all of them and `cargo clean -p <crate>` before testing.** Stale worktree compilation artifacts make new code invisible to `cargo test --list`.
- **Worktree agents may skip commits.** After each worktree agent completes, verify with `git log <base>..<branch> --oneline`; if empty, check for unstaged changes in the worktree directory and commit manually before cleanup.

See the crate-level `AGENTS.md` guides (`crates/cli/AGENTS.md`, `crates/core/AGENTS.md`, `crates/extract/AGENTS.md`, `crates/graph/AGENTS.md`) and `CONTEXT.md` for AI agent integration guidance.
