# Contributing to Fallow

Thanks for your interest in contributing to fallow! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Getting started

Repository tooling requires Node.js 22.12.0 or later. Published Node packages
require Node.js 22 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow.git
cd fallow
git config core.hooksPath .githooks    # Enable commit-msg/pre-commit/pre-push hooks
npm install                            # Install repo tooling such as commitlint
cargo build --workspace
npm run verify:fast                   # Canonical local feedback loop
```

On Windows, enable symlink checkout support before cloning. If you already
cloned the repo, enable it and check out the repo again:

```bash
git config --global core.symlinks true
```

The CLI's bundled GitLab CI templates under `crates/cli/templates/ci/` are
symlinks to the canonical workspace sources under `ci/`. Cargo dereferences
them when packaging the published crate.

## Development workflow

### Building

```bash
cargo build --workspace              # Debug build
cargo build --release -p fallow-cli  # Release build (CLI only)
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run verify                        # Alias for the canonical fast checks
npm run verify:fast                   # Formatting, linting, contracts, boundaries
npm run verify:full                   # Fast checks plus script/npm/Rust tests, benches, docs, NAPI
cargo test -p fallow-core             # Focused single-crate test run
```

Run `npm install` at the repository root and `pnpm install` under
`editors/vscode` before either verification command. Full verification also
requires `npm ci` under `crates/napi` and a local platform compiler. It is the
most comprehensive local gate and is recommended before pushing substantial
changes.

Local verification is deliberately not a simulation of every CI job. Miri,
MSRV and cross-platform jobs, feature-specific and editor integration jobs,
release and publish jobs, and network or real-project smoke tests remain
CI-only. Run `npm run verify:full -- --help` to review the exact local scope and
exclusions.

### Workspace visibility audit

[Hawk](https://github.com/astral-sh/hawk) audits Rust workspace visibility and
dead public declarations across crate boundaries. The scheduled workflow uses
Hawk 0.1.9 with Rust 1.97.1 and keeps the supported `fallow-api` facade, its
re-exported contract crates, and the cross-repo `fallow-license` surface out of
scope.

Install the matching Hawk release, then run:

```bash
./scripts/check-hawk.sh dead-public  # Report dead public declarations
./scripts/check-hawk.sh all          # Include visibility reduction suggestions
```

Hawk is experimental, so its findings are review input rather than an automatic
fix list. Before deleting a declaration or narrowing its visibility, confirm it
is unused by every relevant feature profile and release target. The scheduled
workflow stores its complete output as an artifact for review.

### Fuzzing

The fuzz harnesses require a Rust nightly toolchain and cargo-fuzz 0.13.2:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install cargo-fuzz --version 0.13.2 --locked
cargo +nightly fuzz list
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_sfc -- -max_total_time=30 -timeout=10
```

Each target uses seed inputs from `fuzz/corpus/<target-name>/`. Pull requests
and pushes that affect the parser pipeline run every target for 30 seconds.
The scheduled workflow runs every target for five minutes each week and can
also be started manually. Crashing inputs are retained as workflow artifacts.

### Running locally

```bash
cargo run --bin fallow -- dead-code       # Unused code analysis
cargo run --bin fallow -- dupes           # Duplication detection
cargo run --bin fallow -- health          # Complexity metrics
cargo run --bin fallow -- fix --dry-run   # Auto-fix preview
cargo run --bin fallow -- list --plugins  # Show detected plugins
```

### Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench --bench analysis                                    # Criterion benchmarks
cd benchmarks && npm run generate && npm run bench              # Comparative vs knip
cd benchmarks && npm run generate:dupes && npm run bench:dupes  # vs jscpd
cd benchmarks && npm run generate:circular && npm run bench:circular  # vs madge/dpdm
```

## Project structure

The workspace follows the ownership boundaries in
[`docs/architecture-invariants.md`](docs/architecture-invariants.md):

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/types/` | Shared typed contracts, issue metadata, suppressions, and envelope data. |
| `crates/config/` | Configuration loading, typed configuration, presets, and workspace discovery. |
| `crates/extract/` | Parser-facing facts for JavaScript, TypeScript, framework files, MDX, and CSS. |
| `crates/graph/` | Module graph construction, import resolution, dependency traversal, cycles, and impact facts. |
| `crates/security/` | Shared security matcher catalogue and candidate helpers. |
| `crates/core/` | Internal detector backend used by `fallow-engine` for private detector phases. It is not the supported embedder surface. |
| `crates/engine/` | Analysis sessions, discovery, parsing, graph construction, and typed analysis orchestration. |
| `crates/output/` | Shared output contracts, action builders, summaries, SARIF builders, and reusable formatter pieces. |
| `crates/api/` | Supported Rust facade and programmatic workflow adapters. |
| `crates/cli/` | CLI protocol adapter, command dispatch, terminal interaction, and protocol-specific serialization. |
| `crates/lsp/` | LSP adapter for diagnostics, code actions, hover, and code lens. |
| `crates/mcp/` | MCP adapter exposing fallow as typed tools for AI agents. |
| `crates/multicall/` | Unpublished binary crate bundling the CLI, LSP, and MCP servers into the single `fallow` binary shipped by the npm platform packages. |
| `crates/napi/` | NAPI adapter and Node.js bindings over the supported Rust facade. |
| `crates/license/` | Offline signed-license verification used by licensed CLI capabilities. |
| `crates/v8-coverage/` | V8 coverage parsing and source-offset mapping. |
| `crates/benchmarks/` | CodSpeed and Criterion benchmark suites for the Rust workspace. |
| `editors/vscode/` | VS Code extension and generated TypeScript contract consumer. |
| `editors/zed/` | Zed extension. |
| `editors/nvim/` | Neovim integration documentation. |
| `npm/fallow/` | npm wrapper, launchers, generated types, and bundled agent skill. |
| `npm/<platform>/` | Platform-specific native binary packages consumed by the npm wrapper. |

Dependency direction is deliberate. Foundation and analysis crates do not
depend on protocol adapters. `fallow-core` remains an internal detector backend
behind `fallow-engine`; `fallow-output` shapes reusable contracts without
starting analysis; `fallow-api` provides the supported Rust facade. The CLI,
LSP, MCP, and NAPI adapters translate their protocol options and call
`fallow-api` or `fallow-engine` rather than calling `fallow-core` directly.

## Adding a framework plugin

The most common contribution is adding support for a new framework. Each plugin lives in `crates/core/src/plugins/` as a single Rust file.

1. Create `crates/core/src/plugins/my_framework.rs`.
2. Implement the `Plugin` trait using an existing built-in as a reference.
3. Declare the module in `crates/core/src/plugins/mod.rs`.
4. Import and instantiate it in the correct category in
   `crates/core/src/plugins/registry/builtin.rs`.
5. Add focused plugin tests and an end-to-end fixture.

A minimal plugin needs:
- `name()` — framework name
- `enablers()` — package.json dependencies that activate the plugin
- `entry_patterns()` — glob patterns for entry point files
- Optionally: `resolve_config()` for AST-based config parsing

See the [Plugin Authoring Guide](docs/plugin-authoring.md) for external plugin
files and the built-in extension points.

## Adding an analyzer or finding

New built-in findings need more than detector code: rule metadata, output
formats, suppressions, LSP/MCP surfaces, fixtures, and generated contract files
must move together. Use the [Analyzer Authoring Guide](docs/analyzer-authoring.md)
before adding a new issue kind or framework-specific analyzer.

## Adding a known tooling dependency

Some dev tools are used through the CLI or config rather than imported in source (`typescript`, `prettier`, `husky`, `@types/*`), so they should never be reported as unused devDependencies. These live in a data-driven catalogue at `crates/core/data/tooling.toml`. Adding one is a single-file, one-entry change with no regeneration step:

```toml
# A whole package family (every member is tooling):
[[prefix]]
pattern = "@types/"
notes = "TypeScript type definitions"

# A single package:
[[exact]]
name = "typescript"
ecosystem = "core"
```

- Use `[[prefix]]` when every package under a scope or name family is tooling (matched with `name.starts_with(pattern)`); use `[[exact]]` for a single package name. `notes` / `ecosystem` are optional, for human context only.
- Do **not** add framework-plugin packages (`vite-plugin-*`, `prettier-plugin-*`, `eslint-plugin-*`, `@rollup/plugin-*`, or scoped forms like `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`). Those must be credited by the relevant plugin's config parser when they actually appear in the config file; listing them here would hide a declared-but-unused plugin. The catalogue's parse tests reject such entries.
- Run `cargo test -p fallow-core plugins::tooling` to validate the catalogue (it checks the TOML parses, has no empty/whitespace prefixes, no duplicates, and no framework-plugin entries). The file is embedded into the binary via `include_str!`, so a passing test means a working release.

## Editing the JSON output contract

Fallow's JSON output schema lives in `docs/output-schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07) and is consumed by downstream tools (VS Code extension TypeScript codegen, GitHub Action jq scripts, AI agents using AJV validation).

The schema covers two layers, with different ownership rules:

### Layer 1: types derived from Rust

Rust-owned schema types live across `crates/types/src/` (analysis and base payloads), `crates/output/src/` (health, action, utility, and envelope wire shapes), `crates/api/src/` (programmatic and attribution wrappers), and `crates/config/src/` (configuration inputs). The types, output, and API crates gate their `JsonSchema` derives behind a `schema` feature; config derives `JsonSchema` unconditionally because it also owns the configuration schema. The authoritative output-contract inventory is `derived_definition_names()` plus the corresponding registrations and imports in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs`.

The CLI's `schema-emit` feature enables the feature-gated derives through `fallow-cli/schema` and includes config's always-available schema types, so a single `cargo run -p fallow-cli --features schema-emit --bin fallow-schema-emit` covers the whole tree.

A drift gate (`cargo test -p fallow-cli --features schema-emit --bin fallow-schema-emit`) compares the derived shape against the committed `docs/output-schema.json` and fails when:
- a Rust struct gains a field that is missing from the schema,
- a Rust struct loses a field that is still listed in the schema,
- a Rust field is required but the schema has it optional (or vice versa),
- any structural divergence on the Rust-owned definitions (full equality after canonicalization erases cosmetic differences: doc-comment prose, `oneOf`/`anyOf` choice, single-arm `allOf` wrappers, schemars integer-width hints, `Option<T>` nullable-union form).

To regenerate `docs/output-schema.json` against the Rust source of truth:

```bash
cargo run -p fallow-cli --features schema-emit --bin fallow-schema-emit > docs/output-schema.json
```

Phase 8 closed the prose-and-shape escape hatch: every type in `derived_definition_names()` is regenerated from Rust, with descriptions sourced from `///` doc comments and per-envelope titles from `#[schemars(title = "...")]`. Editing the committed schema by hand on any in-scope definition will fail the strict gate on the next `cargo test`.

### Layer 2: hand-written sections

The following surfaces of `docs/output-schema.json` stay hand-maintained today:

- **Top-level metadata** (`$schema`, `$id`, `$comment`, `title`); the `merge_with_committed` step in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs` preserves them verbatim. `$id` is the canonical raw GitHub URL and is used by consumers to SHA-pin a schema revision (see `docs/backwards-compatibility.md`). `description` is now overwritten by `rewrite_document_root_one_of` to keep it in sync with the typed root.
- **Definitions in `HAND_MAINTAINED_ALLOW_LIST`** inside `drift_tests` in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs`: today this is `CloneFamilyAction`, `CloneGroupAction`, and `CoverageAnalyzeOutput`. Each entry carries a reason linking it to the meta-issue ladder rung that retires it. The strict drift gate's orphan check fires on any other hand-maintained definition, so the allow-list is the canonical record of what stays hand-written and why.
- **`CoverageAnalyzeOutput`** is also listed in `HAND_MAINTAINED_ROOT_ENVELOPES` so it remains reachable from the document root; the `hand_maintained_root_envelopes_appear_in_root_one_of` drift test fires if the entry is silently dropped from the root `oneOf`.

The `committed_property_refs_match_derived_property_refs` drift test catches `$ref`-value drift between derived and committed property shapes (e.g. if a future change repoints `CombinedOutput.dupes` away from `DuplicationReport`); this is a check, not a hand-maintained section.

The document-root `oneOf` is now derived from Rust as of #384 item 6: the typed `FallowOutput` enum in `crates/output/src/root_envelopes.rs` wraps every object-shaped envelope and emits the root union via the `rewrite_document_root_one_of` step in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs`. Editing the root `oneOf` by hand will be reverted on the next regeneration. The root union is `[FallowOutput, CodeClimateOutput, ...HAND_MAINTAINED_ROOT_ENVELOPES]`: `CodeClimateOutput` (a bare JSON array via `#[serde(transparent)]`) is a sibling branch because the planned future move to `#[serde(tag = "kind")]` requires every variant of `FallowOutput` to serialize as an object, which the Code Climate / GitLab Code Quality spec forbids for that one envelope.

If you add a new finding type or utility shape, derive `JsonSchema` on the matching Rust struct, register it in `derived_definition_names()`, and the drift gate forces the schema to follow. **Adding a new top-level envelope** also requires adding a new variant to `FallowOutput` in `crates/output/src/root_envelopes.rs` so the document root keeps documenting every wire shape.

### After editing the schema

Regenerate the complete contract bundle from the repository root after changing
any schema or generated contract surface:

```bash
npm run generate:contracts
```

Before opening a pull request, confirm every committed contract matches a fresh
generation:

```bash
npm run generate:contracts:check
```

## Git conventions

- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- **Commit linting**: `npm run commitlint -- --last --verbose` uses the same rule set as CI
- **Signed commits**: `git commit -S`
- Pre-commit hooks run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` automatically

## Code style

- Follow existing patterns — the codebase is consistent
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` must pass (pedantic lints enabled)
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` must pass
- No `unsafe` without justification
- Prefer early returns with guard clauses

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes with conventional commit messages
4. Ensure `cargo test --workspace` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` pass
5. Open a pull request against `main`
