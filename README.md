Fallow turns a JS/TS repository into a trusted quality report: health score, changed-code risk, hotspots, duplication, architecture issues, dependency hygiene, and cleanup opportunities. It helps you answer:

- What changed?
- What got riskier?
- What should I review?
- What should I refactor?
- What can be safely removed?

Fallow is built for maintainers, CI pipelines, editors, and AI agents that need structured evidence instead of guesses. No AI inside the analyzer. Fallow produces deterministic findings, typed output contracts, and traceable explanations that downstream tools can trust.

Fallow dogfoods its shipped JavaScript and TypeScript surfaces in CI: the VS Code extension and npm wrapper package are analyzed with fallow on every relevant change.

## Quick start

Run a changed-code audit:

```bash
npx fallow audit
```

Example output:

```
Audit scope: 7 changed files vs main

-- Dead Code ---------------------------------------

x 7 unused dependencies · 14 dev/optional dependencies
  21 issues · 1 suppressed · 0 stale suppressions

-- Duplication -------------------------------------

x 3 clone families touching changed files

-- Complexity --------------------------------------

! 2 changed functions above threshold
```

Cleanup opportunities include unused files, unused exports, unused dependencies, stale suppressions, and other code that no longer appears to carry product value.

For machine-readable output:

```bash
npx fallow audit --format json
```

For quality scoring and refactor targets:

```bash
npx fallow health --score --hotspots --targets
```

For cleanup-specific findings:

```bash
npx fallow dead-code
```

123 framework plugins. No Node.js runtime required for static analysis. No config needed for the first run.

## What is Fallow?

Fallow is a codebase intelligence engine for TypeScript and JavaScript projects.

It analyzes your repository as a system, not just as a list of files. It connects static structure, dependency relationships, duplication, complexity, architecture boundaries, package hygiene, and optional runtime evidence into one quality report.

Fallow helps teams:

- review risky pull requests before they merge
- track quality trends over time
- find architectural hotspots
- understand dependency hygiene
- detect duplicated logic
- explain why code is used, unused, risky, or safe to remove
- provide structured repo context to AI agents and editor tools

Linters check files. TypeScript checks types. Fallow checks the codebase. Fallow does not use AI to invent findings. It produces deterministic evidence that humans and agents can inspect.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev fallow   # or: pnpm add -D fallow / yarn add -D fallow / bun add -d fallow
```

Installs the CLI, LSP server, MCP server, and version-matched Agent Skill into `node_modules`. For one-off CLI use, run `npx fallow`; Rust users can also run `cargo install fallow-cli`.

Interactive human runs can show a one-line upgrade hint when a cached latest-version check says the local fallow is stale. Machine formats, CI, quiet runs, and non-TTY agent paths never show the hint; set `FALLOW_UPDATE_CHECK=off` to disable the hint and background check.

Parsing `fallow --format json` in TypeScript? `import type { CheckOutput } from "fallow/types"` gives you the full output contract, version-pinned to your installed CLI.

### Docker

Build the local CLI image from this repository:

```bash
docker build -t fallow:local .
```

Run fallow against a project by mounting it at `/workspace`:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" fallow:local audit --format json --quiet
```

The `--user` mapping keeps `.fallow/` caches and generated reports owned by your host user. It also lets `fallow audit` use git base detection without Git's dubious-ownership guard blocking the mounted repository. The image includes git, Node.js, npm, and Corepack; fallow does not install your project dependencies automatically.

For Compose, copy `examples/docker/compose.yaml` into the target project after building the image, then run:

```bash
docker compose run --rm fallow audit --format json --quiet
```

Fallow is a one-shot CLI, not a long-running service. In Portainer or other stack tools, use a one-shot run command instead of deploying it as an always-on service, or override the command for an interactive shell. Container exit codes are the fallow process exit codes, so CI can gate on the `docker run` or `docker compose run` result directly.

On Linux and WSL, the commands above work as written. On Windows outside WSL, pass an absolute project path accepted by Docker Desktop and keep the mounted working directory at `/workspace`. For containerized runtime coverage inventory, use the container path prefix:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" fallow:local coverage upload-inventory --path-prefix /workspace --format json --quiet
```

Programmatic Node API:

```bash
npm install @fallow-cli/fallow-node   # or: pnpm/yarn/bun add @fallow-cli/fallow-node
```

```ts
import { detectDeadCode, detectDuplication, computeHealth } from '@fallow-cli/fallow-node';

const findings = await detectDeadCode({ root: process.cwd() });
const dupes = await detectDuplication({ root: process.cwd(), mode: 'mild', minTokens: 30 });
const health = await computeHealth({ root: process.cwd(), score: true, ownershipEmails: 'handle' });
```

## What Fallow reports

### Quality score

A compact health score for the current state of the repository, with targets for maintainability, complexity, duplication, dependency hygiene, and architecture.

### PR risk

Changed-code analysis (`fallow audit`) that highlights files and symbols most likely to need review before merge. Returns a verdict (pass / warn / fail) and an attribution split between findings the PR introduced and pre-existing ones.

### Hotspots

Functions, files, and packages that combine complexity, churn, size, coupling, and (with the runtime layer) runtime importance.

### Duplication

Clone families and duplicated implementation patterns that increase maintenance cost. Four detection modes from exact token match to semantic clones with renamed variables. Covers JS, TS, CSS-family stylesheets, Vue and Svelte template and style regions, and Astro template and style regions.

### Architecture

Circular dependencies, boundary violations across layers and modules, re-export chains, and other dependency-graph issues. Zero-config presets for bulletproof, layered, hexagonal, and feature-sliced architectures. Framework correctness checks catch Next.js `"use client"` files that export a server-only or route-segment config name (such as `metadata`, `revalidate`, or a route HTTP method) before the build does. They also flag barrels that re-export both client and server-only modules, and `"use client"` / `"use server"` directives placed below an import where the bundler silently ignores them. Whole-project App Router checks catch route collisions (two files resolving to the same URL across route groups, a `next build` failure) and dynamic-segment name conflicts (`[id]` vs `[slug]` at the same position), scoped per app-root so monorepos with multiple Next apps are not false-flagged. They also flag Server Actions exported from a `"use server"` file that no code in the project calls (no import-and-call, no `action={fn}` binding, no `<form action={fn}>`), the cross-file dead-action direction eslint-plugin-next cannot see.

### Dependency hygiene

Unused dependencies, unresolved imports, duplicate exports, unlisted imports, type-only production deps, test-only production deps, and pnpm catalog and overrides hygiene.

### Cleanup opportunities

Unused files, unused exports, unused types, unused enum members, unused class members, unused Pinia store members, unprovided Vue/Svelte/Angular injects, unused Angular component inputs and outputs, Svelte component events dispatched but listened to nowhere, stale suppression comments, and code paths that appear safe to review for removal. Opt-in API hygiene checks such as private type leaks live here too.

### Runtime intelligence (optional)

Static analysis answers what is connected. Runtime intelligence answers what actually ran in production. Hot paths, cold code, runtime-weighted health, stale flags, runtime-backed PR review. See the [Runtime intelligence](#runtime-intelligence-optional) section below.

### Agent-ready context

Structured JSON, an MCP server, and an LSP for answering "what depends on this?", "why is this used?", "what changed?", and "what action is safest?".

## Built for agents

Fallow gives AI agents structured repo truth instead of forcing them to infer everything from grep.

Agents can ask:

- Who imports this symbol?
- Why is this export considered used?
- Why is this export considered unused?
- What changed in this PR?
- Which files are risky to touch?
- Which files are architectural hotspots?
- What duplicate siblings exist?
- What cleanup action is safest?
- What evidence supports this finding?

Fallow exposes this through JSON output, typed output contracts (`import type { CheckOutput } from "fallow/types"`), the MCP server, and the LSP. Every issue in `--format json` carries a machine-actionable `actions` array with an `auto_fixable` flag so agents can self-correct.

Run `fallow init --agents` to scaffold a starter `AGENTS.md` for project-specific navigation, command, architecture, and safety guidance. The file is guidance for agents, not a readiness score, and fallow will not overwrite an existing guide.

Common agent workflow:

1. generate or edit code
2. run `fallow audit --format json`
3. inspect findings and per-issue `actions`
4. apply safe fixes or adjust the patch before opening a PR
5. hand the result to a human reviewer with better evidence

```bash
npx fallow audit --format json
npx fallow --format json
npx fallow inspect --file src/api.ts --format json
npx fallow --coverage coverage/coverage-final.json --format json
npx fallow fix --dry-run --format json
```

For full adoption instead of one-off review, see the [Fallow compliance happy path](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/blob/main/docs/fallow-compliance.md). It defines the end state and includes a copy-paste agent onboarding prompt.

See [Agent integration](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/mcp) for MCP setup and the full list of structured tools.

Use `fallow inspect --file <path>` or `fallow inspect --symbol <file>:<export>` when an agent needs one evidence bundle before editing. The MCP server exposes the same flow as `inspect_target`, combining trace, dead-code, duplication, complexity, and security signals without inventing a new analysis pass.

The MCP server also exposes `code_execute`, a bounded read-only Code Mode tool for composing multiple fallow analysis calls in one JavaScript snippet. It can call analysis helpers such as `fallow.projectInfo`, `fallow.audit`, and `fallow.checkHealth`, but it does not expose mutating fix tools.

For security review loops, see the [Security agent verification recipe](docs/security-agent-verification.md). It shows how to combine `fallow security --format json --surface`, candidate evidence, and MCP `security_candidates` output without adding model calls to fallow core.

Run `fallow impact` to see what fallow has done for you: how many issues it is surfacing, the trend since your last recorded run, and how many commits its pre-commit gate caught before they shipped. Run `fallow impact --all` to roll every tracked project into one cross-repo view. It is opt-in (`fallow impact enable`) and entirely local: history lives in your user config directory (never written into the repo, so nothing to gitignore) and is never uploaded.

Product telemetry for improving agent, CI, MCP, and editor workflows is off by default. Run `fallow telemetry inspect --example` to see the payload, or `FALLOW_TELEMETRY=inspect fallow audit --format json --quiet` to inspect a real run without sending it. Run `fallow telemetry enable` only when you want to help improve these integrations. See [Telemetry](docs/telemetry.md).

## Why teams using AI need Fallow

AI accelerates code creation. It does not eliminate review, cleanup, or architecture drift.

When Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or other tools generate changes, teams still need to know:

- did this introduce risky complexity?
- did it duplicate logic that already existed?
- did the change cross an architectural boundary it should not cross?
- did it leave behind unused code or stale dependencies?
- is this code on a hot path or a cold one?
- what should the reviewer read closely first?

Fallow answers those questions with deterministic, graph-based analysis and structured output, so both humans and agents can act on facts instead of guesses.

## More static commands

```bash
fallow                       # Full codebase analysis: cleanup + duplication + health
fallow audit                 # Audit changed files (verdict: pass/warn/fail)
fallow review                # Advisory review brief over changed files (always exits 0)
fallow decision-surface      # Ranked structural decisions a change embeds
fallow trace src/utils.ts:formatDate  # Symbol-level call chains (callers up, callees down)
fallow health                # Complexity + refactor targets
fallow health --css          # + structural CSS analytics (specificity, !important, nesting)
fallow dupes                 # Repeated logic
fallow dead-code             # Cleanup candidates
fallow security              # Security candidates, hardcoded-secret needs explicit category include
fallow security survivors    # Render verifier-filtered survivor candidates
fallow security blind-spots  # Group unresolved security callees
fallow explain unused-export # Explain a rule without analyzing
fallow watch                 # Re-analyze on file changes
fallow fix --dry-run         # Preview automatic cleanup
```

Combined mode (`fallow`) and `fallow audit` support per-analysis production mode. Precedence is CLI flags, then environment variables, then config:

```jsonc
{
  "production": {
    "health": true,
    "deadCode": false,
    "dupes": false
  }
}
```

Use `--production-health`, `--production-dead-code`, or `--production-dupes` for one invocation, or `FALLOW_PRODUCTION_HEALTH=true` and related env vars in CI. The global `--production` flag still enables production mode for every analysis.

`fallow security` remains opt-in and ranks reachable active-code candidates first. It includes source-backed ReDoS regex candidates for risky literal patterns applied to untrusted input, while safe literal patterns and source-free uses stay quiet. When a sink is also reported as dead code, JSON includes `dead_code` context and the command points agents toward deleting the unused file or removing the unused export before hardening that sink. Use `fallow security --gate new --changed-since <ref>` for changed-line candidate gating, or `fallow security --gate newly-reachable --changed-since <ref>` when an existing sink becoming entry-reachable should block the change for review. Use `fallow security survivors --candidates fallow-security.json --verdicts verdicts.json` to render verifier-filtered survivors, and `fallow security blind-spots` to group unresolved callee blind spots. See the [Security agent verification recipe](docs/security-agent-verification.md) for the full workflow.

Precedence (highest to lowest): CLI flags, per-analysis env var, global `FALLOW_PRODUCTION`, config. CLI flags only enable; env vars and config can also disable. Worked examples:

```bash
# Run health in production mode, dead-code and dupes on the full tree
fallow --production-health

# Same, via env var (useful in CI templates that pass env-only)
FALLOW_PRODUCTION_HEALTH=true fallow

# Per-analysis env wins over the global env, so this runs health in production mode
# even though the global env says off (the typical CI-template defaults case)
FALLOW_PRODUCTION=false FALLOW_PRODUCTION_HEALTH=true fallow

# CLI flags beat env vars; this turns ALL three on regardless of any FALLOW_PRODUCTION_* env
fallow --production
```

## Cleanup opportunities

Cleanup opportunities are code that no longer appears to carry product value: unused files, exports, dependencies, types, enum members, class members, Pinia store members, unprovided Vue/Svelte/Angular injects, unused Angular component inputs and outputs, Svelte component events listened to nowhere, unresolved imports, unlisted dependencies, duplicate exports, circular dependencies (including cross-package cycles in monorepos), boundary violations, type-only dependencies, test-only production dependencies, and stale suppression comments. Workspace package dependencies are checked like external packages, so unused or undeclared internal package edges are visible in monorepos. Entry points are auto-detected from package.json fields, package scripts, framework conventions, and plugin patterns. Public class members on classes exposed from non-private package entry points or exportless source subpath indexes are treated as library API surface, while reachable internal classes still get member-level checks. Arrow-wrapped dynamic imports (`React.lazy`, `loadable`, `defineAsyncComponent`) and proven local `child_process.fork()` runner targets are tracked as references. Script multiplexers (`concurrently`, `npm-run-all`) are analyzed to discover transitive script dependencies. JSDoc tags (`@public`, `@internal`, `@beta`, `@alpha`, `@expected-unused`) control export visibility. Private type leaks are currently opt-in API hygiene findings via `--private-type-leaks` or the `private-type-leaks` rule.

```bash
fallow dead-code                          # All dead code issues
fallow dead-code --unused-exports         # Only unused exports
fallow dead-code --private-type-leaks     # Opt-in private type leak API hygiene
fallow dead-code --circular-deps          # Only circular dependencies
fallow dead-code --boundary-violations    # Only boundary violations
fallow dead-code --stale-suppressions     # Only stale suppression comments
fallow dead-code --production             # Exclude test/dev files
fallow dead-code --changed-since main     # Only changed files (for PRs)
fallow dead-code --file src/utils.ts       # Single file (lint-staged integration)
fallow dead-code --include-entry-exports  # Also check exports from entry files
fallow dead-code --group-by owner         # Group by CODEOWNERS for team triage
fallow dead-code --group-by directory     # Group by first directory component
fallow dead-code --group-by package       # Group by workspace package (monorepo)
fallow dead-code --group-by section       # Group by GitLab CODEOWNERS section
```

## Duplication

Finds copy-pasted code blocks across your codebase, including CSS-family stylesheets and authored template/style regions in Vue, Svelte, and Astro files. Suffix-array algorithm -- no quadratic pairwise comparison. Repeated atomic function calls are filtered by default, so long calls to an existing shared abstraction do not show up as refactoring work.

```bash
fallow dupes                              # Default (mild mode)
fallow dupes --mode semantic              # Catch clones with renamed variables
fallow dupes --skip-local                 # Only cross-directory duplicates
fallow dupes --group-by owner             # Partition clone groups by CODEOWNERS team
fallow dupes --group-by directory         # Partition clone groups by directory
fallow dupes --format compact             # One parseable line per clone instance
fallow dupes --trace src/utils.ts:42      # Show all clones of code at this location
fallow dupes --trace dup:7f3a2c1e         # Deep-dive a clone group by its dup:<id> fingerprint
```

Clone fingerprints are usually short `dup:<8hex>` ids and widen only when a
rare report collision requires it.

Four detection modes: **strict** (exact tokens), **mild** (default, AST-based), **weak** (different string literals), **semantic** (renamed variables and literals).

## Complexity

Surfaces the most complex functions in your codebase and identifies where to spend refactoring effort. Angular, Vue, and Svelte templates are included as synthetic `<template>` entries when they use control flow or complex bindings, covering Angular external `templateUrl` files and inline `@Component({ template: \`...\` })` decorators as well as the `<template>` block of `.vue` and `.svelte` single-file components.

```bash
fallow health                             # Functions/templates exceeding thresholds
fallow health --score                     # Project health score (0-100) with letter grade
fallow health --min-score 70              # CI gate: fail if score drops below 70
fallow health --top 20                    # 20 most complex functions
fallow health --file-scores               # Per-file maintainability index (0-100)
fallow health --hotspots                  # Riskiest files (git churn x complexity)
fallow health --hotspots --ownership      # Add bus factor, owner, drift signals
fallow health --hotspots --churn-file churn.json   # Import history (non-git VCS: Arc, hg, p4)
fallow health --workspace @scope/app      # Scope vital signs + score to one package
fallow health --group-by package --score  # Per-package vital signs + score (monorepos)
fallow health --targets                   # Ranked refactoring recommendations
fallow health --targets --effort low      # Only quick-win refactoring targets
fallow health --coverage-gaps             # Static test coverage gaps
fallow health --coverage coverage/coverage-final.json
fallow health --coverage artifacts/coverage.json --coverage-root /home/runner/work/myapp
fallow health --runtime-coverage ./coverage
fallow health --runtime-coverage ./coverage --min-invocations-hot 250
fallow health --trend                     # Compare against saved snapshot
fallow health --changed-since main        # Only changed files
```

Use `health.thresholdOverrides` for intentional local ceilings on legacy files
or generated adapters while keeping global thresholds strict. Each override
matches `files` globs, optionally narrows to exact `functions`, and can set any
of `maxCyclomatic`, `maxCognitive`, or `maxCrap`. JSON, compact, markdown, and
human output report active, stale, and full-run no-match override state so
temporary exceptions stay visible.

## Runtime intelligence (optional)

Static analysis answers: **what is connected to what?**

Runtime intelligence answers: **what actually ran?**

Fallow Runtime is the optional paid team layer. It uses runtime coverage as the collection engine (V8 dumps via `NODE_V8_COVERAGE=...` and Istanbul `coverage-final.json` files), then merges that evidence into `fallow health` so teams and coding agents can:

- review changes on hot production paths more carefully
- delete cold code with stronger evidence
- prioritize refactors by runtime importance
- spot stale feature-flag branches and stale runtime code
- give agents factual usage data instead of assumptions

```bash
fallow license activate --trial --email you@company.com
fallow coverage setup
fallow health --runtime-coverage ./coverage
fallow coverage analyze --cloud --repo owner/repo --format json
```

Static `coverage_gaps` and runtime `runtime_coverage` are separate layers in the same `health` surface:

| Surface | Flag | Input | Answers | License |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Static test reachability | `--coverage-gaps` | none | which runtime files/exports have no test dependency path | no |
| Exact CRAP scoring | `--coverage` | Istanbul JSON file or `coverage-final.json` directory | how covered each function is for CRAP computation | no |
| Runtime runtime coverage | `--runtime-coverage` | V8 directory, V8 JSON file, or Istanbul JSON file | which functions actually executed, which stayed cold, which are hot | yes |

When enough evidence overlaps, `health` also emits `coverage_intelligence`: a combined verdict layer for humans and agents. It turns compound signals into stable findings, for example changed hot paths with high CRAP and low tests, static unused code that was also cold at runtime, cold reachable code with ownership risk, or hot covered code that needs careful refactoring. The block is additive and appears inside `audit` through the nested health result without changing audit's default verdict.

Setup details:

- `fallow license activate --trial --email ...` starts a trial and stores the signed license locally
- `fallow license refresh` refreshes the stored license before the hard-fail window
- `fallow coverage setup` detects your framework and package manager, installs the sidecar if needed, writes a collection recipe, and resumes from the current setup state on re-run
- `fallow coverage setup --yes --json` emits deterministic agent-readable setup instructions without prompts, file writes, installs, or network calls. Add `--explain` to include a `_meta` block with field definitions, enum values, warning semantics, and the docs URL. In workspaces it emits per-runtime-package `members[]`, unions `runtime_targets`, prefixes member file paths, and skips pure workspace aggregator roots
- `fallow coverage analyze --cloud --repo owner/repo --format json` explicitly fetches the latest cloud runtime facts for a repo, merges them locally with the current AST/static analysis, and emits the same `runtime_coverage` JSON block. `FALLOW_API_KEY` alone does not enable cloud mode; pass `--cloud`, `--runtime-coverage-cloud`, or set `FALLOW_RUNTIME_COVERAGE_SOURCE=cloud`.
- `fallow coverage upload-inventory` pushes a static function inventory to fallow cloud so the dashboard's `Untracked` filter (functions that exist but never run) lights up. Runs in CI, respects `.gitignore` + `--exclude-paths`, preserves same-named functions by their line-aware cloud identity, and warns when inventory paths do not overlap recent runtime paths. For containerized deployments, pass `--path-prefix /app` (or your Dockerfile `WORKDIR`) so inventory paths match what the runtime beacon reports
- `fallow coverage upload-source-maps` uploads build `.map` files from CI so bundled runtime coverage resolves back to original source paths. Defaults to `dist/**/*.map`, `$GITHUB_SHA`, and basename matching; pass `--strip-path=false` when coverage reports bundle paths like `assets/app.js`
- Cloud API calls accept `FALLOW_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/bundle.pem` for custom PEM trust bundles. The bundle replaces the default WebPKI roots, so private-CA environments should pass a complete trust bundle. `upload-source-maps` honors 429 `Retry-After` backoff, caps waits at 60 seconds, and exits 7 when setup or transport failures prevent every upload.
- The sidecar can be installed globally or as a project devDependency; fallow resolves `FALLOW_COV_BIN`, project-local shims, package-manager bin lookups, `~/.fallow/bin/fallow-cov`, and `PATH`
- `fallow health --runtime-coverage <path>` accepts a V8 directory, a single V8 JSON file, or a single Istanbul coverage map JSON file (commonly `coverage-final.json`)
- `fallow health --coverage <path>` accepts a single Istanbul coverage map JSON file or a directory containing `coverage-final.json`; bare `fallow --coverage <path>` forwards the same data to its embedded health analysis
- `--coverage-root <path>` must be an absolute prefix from the Istanbul file paths. Use it when coverage was generated in CI or Docker with a different checkout root, for example `fallow health --coverage artifacts/coverage-final.json --coverage-root /home/runner/work/myapp`
- Standalone health and bare `fallow` resolve each coverage input as CLI flag, then `FALLOW_COVERAGE` / `FALLOW_COVERAGE_ROOT`, then `health.coverage` / `health.coverageRoot`, then auto-detection where supported
- V8 dumps that include Node's `source-map-cache` are remapped through supported source-map paths before analysis, including file paths, relative paths, `webpack://...`, and `vite://...`; unsupported virtual schemes safely fall back to raw V8 handling
- `fallow health --changed-since <ref> --runtime-coverage <path>` promotes touched hot paths to a `hot-path-touched` verdict during change review

Runtime coverage is merged into the same human, JSON, SARIF, compact, markdown, and CodeClimate outputs as the rest of the health report.

## Audit

PR risk gate for human and AI-generated code. Combines changed-file cleanup findings from the dead-code pass with changed-file complexity and duplication findings, then emits a verdict.

```bash
fallow audit                              # Auto-detects base branch
fallow audit --base main                  # Explicit base ref
fallow audit --base HEAD~3               # Audit last 3 commits
fallow audit --production-health          # Production health, full dead-code/dupes
fallow audit --coverage artifacts/coverage-final.json --coverage-root /home/runner/work/myapp
fallow audit --gate all                   # Fail on inherited findings too
fallow audit --format json                # Structured output with verdict
```

Returns a verdict: **pass** (exit 0), **warn** (exit 0, warn-severity only), or **fail** (exit 1). By default, audit compares the current tree with the base ref and gates only findings introduced by the changeset; inherited findings are counted in JSON `attribution`, individual issue objects get `introduced: true|false`, and inherited findings are shown as context. Set `--gate all` or `audit.gate: "all"` to fail on every finding in changed files without running the extra base-snapshot attribution pass.

`audit` forwards `--coverage` and `--coverage-root` to its health sub-analysis for exact Istanbul-backed CRAP scoring. Relative `--coverage` paths resolve against `--root`; `--coverage-root` must be an absolute prefix from the coverage data. `FALLOW_COVERAGE` and `FALLOW_COVERAGE_ROOT` are used as fallbacks when the corresponding CLI flags are omitted. Health JSON includes `coverage_source` on CRAP findings and `summary.coverage_source_consistency` when those findings use a uniform source or mix Istanbul data with estimates.

Audit caches base snapshots under `.fallow/cache/` by default and may keep a SHA-scoped temporary git worktree for reuse across runs against the same base ref. Set `cache.dir` or `FALLOW_CACHE_DIR` to relocate the persistent analysis cache; relative paths resolve from the project root. When the current checkout has `node_modules`, audit links it into the base worktree so tsconfig `extends` chains into installed packages and path aliases resolve like the working tree. Transient worktrees are removed on normal exit. Use `--no-cache` to disable snapshot and reusable-worktree caching; if a process is force-killed, run `git worktree prune` to clean up stale `.git/worktrees/fallow-audit-base-*` entries.

**Per-analysis baselines.** When touching legacy files with pre-existing issues, reuse the baselines saved by the individual subcommands so audit only fails on genuinely new findings:

```bash
# Save once from a clean ref
fallow dead-code --save-baseline fallow-baselines/dead-code.json
fallow health    --save-baseline fallow-baselines/health.json
fallow dupes     --save-baseline fallow-baselines/dupes.json

# Feed into audit on every PR
fallow audit \
  --dead-code-baseline fallow-baselines/dead-code.json \
  --health-baseline    fallow-baselines/health.json \
  --dupes-baseline     fallow-baselines/dupes.json
```

Keep committed baselines outside `.fallow/`; that directory is for cache and local data and is typically gitignored. `fallow-baselines/` is the recommended default. Configure defaults in `.fallowrc.json` under `audit.deadCodeBaseline` / `audit.healthBaseline` / `audit.dupesBaseline` so CI stays one command (`fallow audit`). CLI flags override config.

## CI integration

Use the GitHub Action when you want fallow to handle installation, caching, PR scoping, annotations, review comments, SARIF, and job-summary formatting.

```yaml
name: Fallow

on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read
  checks: write # needed for the Fallow Check Run
  pull-requests: write # needed for comment/review-comments
  id-token: write # optional: post PR comments as the branded Fallow app

jobs:
  fallow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # best diff precision for --changed-since and hotspots
      - uses: fallow-rs/fallow@v2
        with:
          command: audit
          comment: true
          review-comments: true
```

With `id-token: write`, PR comments and reviews are posted by the Fallow app (a branded bot) once the app is installed on the repository. Without it, or if the app is not installed, output posts under the default `github-actions` bot, no configuration needed and no account required.

`command: audit` is the PR gate. In pull requests, the Action auto-scopes to the PR base SHA when `changed-since` is not set, derives a unified diff for line-level filtering, and emits a verdict: **pass**, **warn**, or **fail**. With the default `fail-on-issues: true`, audit fails the job only on verdict `fail`; warn-tier findings stay visible without blocking merge.

Useful GitHub Action modes:

```yaml
# Rich PR feedback without GitHub Advanced Security

```

Action outputs include:

- `issues` -- command-specific issue count; for audit, this is gate-aware
- `verdict` -- audit verdict (`pass`, `warn`, `fail`)
- `gate` -- audit gate (`new-only` or `all`) or security gate (`new` or `newly-reachable`)
- `results` / `sarif` -- generated artifact paths
- `changed-files-unavailable` -- `true` if PR file enumeration degraded and analysis ran less scoped than expected
- `dedup-lookup-failed` / `post-skipped-reason` -- comment/review posting degradation signals

Set `artifacts-dir` to write generated files such as `fallow-results.json`, `fallow-results.sarif`, `fallow-stderr.log`, and `fallow-analysis-args.sh` under a project-local generated directory. The default is `.` for backward compatibility, and the `results` / `sarif` outputs report the resolved paths for downstream steps.

SARIF upload requires GitHub Code Scanning, which is available on public repositories and on private repositories with GitHub Advanced Security enabled. If it is unavailable, the Action skips upload with a warning and leaves the job summary, annotations, comments, and JSON output intact.

GitHub inline review comments target the current PR file state (`side: RIGHT`). Findings on deleted lines are not modeled yet; fallow's diagnostics are current-state oriented in normal use.

For GitLab, use the bundled template. It installs fallow, sets `GIT_DEPTH: "0"`, caches `.fallow/`, produces Code Quality reports by default, and can post summary comments and inline MR discussions.

```yaml
# GitLab CI -- remote include
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fallow-rs/fallow/vX.Y.Z/ci/gitlab-ci.yml'

fallow:
  extends: .fallow
  variables:
    FALLOW_COMMAND: "audit"
    FALLOW_COMMENT: "true"
    FALLOW_SUMMARY_SCOPE: "diff"
    FALLOW_REVIEW: "true"
    FALLOW_REVIEW_GUIDANCE: "true"
    FALLOW_MAX_CRAP: "30"
    FALLOW_COVERAGE: "artifacts/coverage-final.json"
    FALLOW_COVERAGE_ROOT: "/home/runner/work/myapp"
```

When `FALLOW_COMMAND` is empty, the template runs bare `fallow` and forwards `FALLOW_COVERAGE` plus `FALLOW_COVERAGE_ROOT` to the embedded health pass. The GitHub Action does the same for an empty `command` input.

To gate only security candidates introduced by a merge request, use `FALLOW_COMMAND: "security"` and `FALLOW_SECURITY_GATE: "new"`. Use `newly-reachable` when an existing candidate becoming reachable from entry points should block review. Security gate failures exit 8, and the wrapper count reflects only the candidates that matched the selected gate.

`FALLOW_COMMENT` and `FALLOW_REVIEW` require `GITLAB_TOKEN` with API scope. In MR pipelines, the template auto-sets `FALLOW_CHANGED_SINCE` from the MR diff base SHA when possible and derives `FALLOW_DIFF_FILE` for line-level filtering. For monorepos, set `FALLOW_CHANGED_WORKSPACES: "origin/main"` to scope analysis to touched workspaces. Set `FALLOW_SUMMARY_SCOPE=diff` when the sticky summary should hide pre-existing project-level findings outside the diff.

`FALLOW_REVIEW` uses the typed `review-gitlab` envelope v2, not scraped human output. That gives the template stable v2 fingerprints, same-line comment merging, UTF-8-safe body truncation, stale-thread reconciliation via `fallow ci reconcile-review`, and GitLab diff positions for inline discussions. The review script fetches MR `diff_refs` automatically; set `FALLOW_GITLAB_BASE_SHA`, `FALLOW_GITLAB_START_SHA`, or `FALLOW_GITLAB_HEAD_SHA` only when your runner needs explicit overrides.

```yaml
# GitLab CI -- vendored include when runners cannot reach GitHub raw
# Run once locally: npx fallow ci-template gitlab --vendor
# Commit the generated ci/ + action/ files.
include:
  - local: 'ci/gitlab-ci.yml'

fallow:
  extends: .fallow
```

For any other CI system, call the CLI directly:

```bash
# PR gate with changed-file attribution
npx fallow audit --changed-since origin/main --format json --quiet

# SARIF for code scanning systems
npx fallow --ci

# Line-level PR filtering from a unified diff
git diff --unified=0 origin/main...HEAD > fallow-pr.diff
npx fallow audit --changed-since origin/main --diff-file fallow-pr.diff

# Health score gate
npx fallow health --score --min-score 80 --quiet

# Security candidate gate
npx fallow security --gate new --changed-since origin/main --format json --quiet
```

Common CI flags:

- `--group-by owner|directory|package|section` -- group output by CODEOWNERS ownership, directory, workspace package, or GitLab CODEOWNERS `[Section]` headers for team-level triage
- `--summary` -- show only category counts (no individual issues)
- `--changed-since main` -- analyze only files touched in a PR
- `--diff-file <path>` / `--diff-stdin` -- filter source-anchored findings to added diff hunks, while project-level package findings bypass analysis line filtering. Sticky summary comments can use `FALLOW_SUMMARY_SCOPE=diff` to filter project-level findings too
- `--changed-workspaces origin/main` -- scope monorepo analysis to workspaces containing any changed file (CI primitive; fails hard on git errors so CI never silently widens back to the full repo)
- `fallow security --gate new|newly-reachable` -- fail only on security candidates introduced by the change or newly reachable from entry points. The official Action exposes this as `security-gate`, and GitLab exposes it as `FALLOW_SECURITY_GATE`
- `--baseline` / `--save-baseline` -- fail only on **new** issues for individual analyses; audit uses the per-analysis baselines shown above
- `--fail-on-regression` / `--tolerance 2%` -- fail only if issues **grew** beyond tolerance
- `--format sarif` -- upload to GitHub Code Scanning
- `--format codeclimate` -- GitLab Code Quality inline MR annotations
- `--format pr-comment-github` / `--format pr-comment-gitlab` -- typed sticky PR/MR comment markdown
- `--format review-github` / `--format review-gitlab` -- typed inline review envelopes for CI scripts
- `--format annotations` -- GitHub Actions inline PR annotations (no Action required)
- `--format json` / `--format markdown` -- for custom workflows (JSON includes machine-actionable `actions` per issue)
- `--format badge` -- shields.io-compatible SVG health badge (`fallow health --format badge > badge.svg`)

Both the GitHub Action and GitLab CI template auto-detect your package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn) from lock files, so install/uninstall commands in review comments match your project.

Adopt incrementally -- surface issues without blocking CI, then promote when ready:

```jsonc
{ "rules": { "unused-files": "error", "unused-exports": "warn", "circular-dependencies": "off" } }
```

### GitLab CI rich MR comments

The GitLab CI template can post rich comments directly on merge requests -- summary comments with collapsible sections and inline review discussions with suggestion blocks.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FALLOW_COMMENT` | `"false"` | Post a summary comment on the MR with collapsible sections per analysis |
| `FALLOW_REVIEW` | `"false"` | Post inline MR discussions from the typed `review-gitlab` envelope v2, with stable fingerprints, suggestions, dedupe, and stale-thread reconciliation |
| `FALLOW_REVIEW_GUIDANCE` | `"false"` | Add collapsed "What to do" guidance blocks to inline review discussions |
| `FALLOW_MAX_COMMENTS` | `"50"` | Maximum number of inline review comments |
| `FALLOW_PR_COMMENT_LAYOUT` | `"default"` | Sticky MR comment layout: `default`, `compact`, `gate-only`, or `details` |
| `FALLOW_SUMMARY_SCOPE` | `"all"` | Sticky MR summary scope. Use `all` to include project-level dependency/catalog/override findings even when their anchor line is outside the diff; use `diff` to apply the diff filter to those findings too. Inline review comments are unaffected |
| `FALLOW_DIFF_FILTER` | `"added"` | Filter line-level findings to added diff hunks by default; use `diff_context`, `file`, or `nofilter` to widen review scope |
| `FALLOW_GITLAB_BASE_SHA` / `FALLOW_GITLAB_START_SHA` / `FALLOW_GITLAB_HEAD_SHA` | `""` | Optional overrides for the GitLab MR `diff_refs` used to build inline discussion positions |
| `FALLOW_SCRIPTS_REF` | `""` | Pinned tag or commit for remote MR-integration scripts; leave empty to prefer vendored local `ci/` + `action/` scripts |
| `FALLOW_VERSION` | `""` | Fallow version to install. Empty reads the project's `package.json` `fallow` dependency, then falls back to `latest`; set explicitly to override the local pin |
| `FALLOW_SKIP_INSTALL` | `""` | Set to `"true"` to skip `npm install -g fallow` and use the `fallow` already resolvable on `PATH` (for example a pnpm-catalog pin you expose by adding its `node_modules/.bin` to `PATH`, or a global install). The job fails fast if no `fallow` is found. Lets you run the template's MR feedback against your own pinned binary and base `image:` |

In MR pipelines, `--changed-since` is set automatically to scope analysis to changed files, and the comment / review scripts derive a unified diff so inline discussions stay on touched lines by default. Fallow edits sticky comments in place and fingerprints inline review comments so repeated runs can skip duplicates. `FALLOW_SUMMARY_SCOPE=diff` keeps the sticky summary focused too: a pre-existing unused dependency in an unrelated package is hidden, while a newly added unused dependency in a changed `package.json` remains visible. If the diff cannot be fetched or read, fallow keeps the existing fail-open behavior and reports all findings.

The v2 review envelope keeps MR threads readable by grouping findings that land on the same path and line into one comment, preserving a machine-readable `marker_regex`, and carrying GitLab `position` data (`old_path`, `new_path`, `new_line`, and diff refs) for reliable inline discussions, including renamed files.

For remote includes, pin the template to a release tag and keep `FALLOW_SCRIPTS_REF` on the same tag or commit. If your GitLab runners cannot reach `raw.githubusercontent.com`, run `npx fallow ci-template gitlab --vendor` locally, commit the generated `ci/` and `action/` files, and use GitLab's local include syntax. The vendored template prefers local scripts and skips the remote fetch path entirely.

A `GITLAB_TOKEN` (PAT or project access token with `api` scope) is required for summary comments and inline MR discussions. GitLab's documented `CI_JOB_TOKEN` permissions allow reading MR notes, but not creating, updating, or deleting them. `CI_JOB_TOKEN` is still useful for GitLab package registry authentication.

GitLab setup gotchas:

- The template sets `GIT_STRATEGY: "fetch"` so shared templates that set `GIT_STRATEGY=none` do not leave fallow without a working tree.
- The template sets `GIT_DEPTH: "0"` so `--changed-since` can diff against the MR base SHA without shallow-clone ambiguity.
- For private GitLab npm registries, create `.npmrc` during the job with `${CI_PROJECT_ID}` and `${CI_JOB_TOKEN}` rather than committing tokens.
- For pnpm projects with `minimumReleaseAge`, add `fallow` and `@fallow-cli/*` to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` when you need to consume a just-published fallow release immediately.
- To run the template against a fallow you install yourself (e.g. a pnpm-catalog pin), set `FALLOW_SKIP_INSTALL: "true"`, override `image:` to your base image, and make sure your install step leaves `fallow` resolvable on the job shell's `PATH`. A bare `pnpm install`/`npm install` only writes `node_modules/.bin/fallow`, which GitLab does **not** add to `PATH` automatically, so prepend it yourself. A job that `extends: .fallow` and defines its own `before_script` **replaces** the template's `before_script` (GitLab does not merge them), so compose with `!reference` to keep the template's install + script-prep block:

  ```yaml
  fallow:
    extends: .fallow
    before_script:
      - export PATH="$CI_PROJECT_DIR/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
      - !reference [.fallow, before_script]
    variables:
      FALLOW_SKIP_INSTALL: "true"
  ```

  The job then skips `npm install -g fallow` and runs your exact binary, so CI matches your local lint gate. If you also enable `FALLOW_COMMENT`/`FALLOW_REVIEW` and your binary is a dev build whose `--version` is not an exact release (e.g. `2.3.0-dev`), pin `FALLOW_SCRIPTS_REF` to a real tag or vendor `ci/scripts/` so the MR-integration scripts can still be fetched.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml -- full example with rich MR comments
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fallow-rs/fallow/vX.Y.Z/ci/gitlab-ci.yml'

fallow:
  extends: .fallow
  variables:
    FALLOW_COMMENT: "true"       # Summary comment with collapsible sections
    FALLOW_SUMMARY_SCOPE: "diff" # Filter project-level findings in the sticky summary too
    FALLOW_REVIEW: "true"        # Inline discussions with suggestion blocks
    FALLOW_REVIEW_GUIDANCE: "true" # Collapsed "What to do" blocks in inline discussions
    FALLOW_MAX_COMMENTS: "30"    # Cap inline comments (default: 50)
    FALLOW_SCRIPTS_REF: "vX.Y.Z" # Match the pinned template ref when using remote scripts
    FALLOW_FAIL_ON_ISSUES: "true"
```

## Configuration

Works out of the box. When you need to customize, create `.fallowrc.json` or run `fallow init`:

```jsonc
// .fallowrc.json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fallow-rs/fallow/main/schema.json",
  "entry": ["src/workers/*.ts", "scripts/*.ts"],
  "ignorePatterns": ["**/*.generated.ts"],
  "ignoreDependencies": ["autoprefixer"],
  "ignoreUnresolvedImports": ["@example/icons", "@example/icons/**"],
  "ignoreExportsUsedInFile": true,
  "rules": {
    "unused-files": "error",
    "unused-exports": "warn",
    "unused-types": "off"
  },
  "health": {
    "maxCyclomatic": 20,
    "maxCognitive": 15,
    "maxCrap": 30,
    "crapRefactorBand": 5,
    "thresholdOverrides": [
      {
        "files": ["src/legacy/**"],
        "functions": ["legacyFlow"],
        "maxCyclomatic": 30,
        "maxCognitive": 25,
        "reason": "legacy migration"
      }
    ]
  },
  "cache": {
    "dir": ".cache/fallow"
  },
  "fix": {
    "catalog": {
      "deletePrecedingComments": "auto"
    }
  }
}
```

See [Environment variables](docs/environment-variables.md) for the full list.

Fallow recognizes four config file names. Precedence is first-match-wins per
directory, walking up to the workspace root:

`.fallowrc.json` > `.fallowrc.jsonc` > `fallow.toml` > `.fallow.toml`

`.fallowrc.json` accepts JSONC: comments and trailing commas are allowed.
`.fallowrc.jsonc` is identical in behavior; the `.jsonc` extension exists only
as a hint to editors that comments are expected. Pick whichever your tooling
prefers. If more than one of these files coexists in the same directory, fallow
loads the higher-precedence one and prints a warning on stderr naming the file
it ignored, so a stale config left over from a migration cannot silently win.

`fix.catalog.deletePrecedingComments` controls how `fallow fix` handles YAML
comment blocks immediately above removed pnpm catalog entries: `"auto"` deletes
blocks that clearly belong to the entry, `"always"` deletes every contiguous
leading block, and `"never"` preserves them. To protect a specific comment
regardless of policy, mark any line in the block with `# fallow-keep`:

```yaml
catalog:
  # fallow-keep: audit trail, CVE-2024-XXXX
  react: ^18.2.0
```

Section-banner comments (3+ repeated `=`, `-`, `*`, `_`, `~`, `+`, or `#`
characters, e.g. `# === React 18 production pins ===`) are also preserved by
the `"auto"` policy so curated dividers survive cleanup.

Architecture boundary presets enforce import rules between layers with zero manual config:

```jsonc
{ "boundaries": { "preset": "bulletproof" } } // or: layered, hexagonal, feature-sliced
```

For custom feature-module boundaries, `autoDiscover` turns each immediate child
directory into its own zone while rules still reference the logical parent:

```jsonc
{
  "boundaries": {
    "zones": [
      { "name": "app", "patterns": ["src/app/**"] },
      { "name": "features", "patterns": ["src/features/**"], "autoDiscover": ["src/features"] },
      { "name": "shared", "patterns": ["src/shared/**"] }
    ],
    "rules": [
      { "from": "app", "allow": ["features", "shared"] },
      { "from": "features", "allow": ["shared"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

When an `autoDiscover` zone also has `patterns`, discovered child zones are matched first and top-level files fall back to the parent zone. The parent rule automatically allows its discovered children, so `src/features/index.ts` barrels can re-export feature modules while non-barrel top-level files such as `src/features/types.ts` still follow the parent `features` rule. Omit `patterns` when you want only discovered child directories classified.

To catch files that are reachable but assigned to no zone, enable boundary coverage:

```jsonc
{
  "boundaries": {
    "zones": [{ "name": "domain", "patterns": ["src/domain/**"] }],
    "coverage": {
      "requireAllFiles": true,
      "allowUnmatched": ["src/generated/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

`requireAllFiles` reports unzoned source files as `boundary_coverage_violations`. Use `allowUnmatched` for generated files or other intentionally unzoned paths.

To ban specific calls from a zone (for example, keeping a domain layer free of process execution and logging), add a forbidden-call policy:

```jsonc
{
  "boundaries": {
    "zones": [{ "name": "domain", "patterns": ["src/domain/**"] }],
    "calls": {
      "forbidden": [
        { "from": "domain", "callee": "child_process.*" },
        { "from": "domain", "callee": ["console.*", "process.exit"] }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each matching call reports as a `boundary_call_violations` finding naming the written callee, the matched pattern, and the zone. Matching is segment-aware, not substring or glob: `fetch` matches only `fetch` (never `myfetch`), a trailing `object.*` matches any member (`child_process.*` matches `child_process.exec`), and a leading `*.member` matches any object (`*.innerHTML` matches `el.innerHTML`). Patterns also match through import provenance, so `child_process.*` covers `import { execSync } from "node:child_process"`, the bare `child_process` specifier, and namespace imports alike. Two scope rules to know: forbidden-call rules apply only to files classified into a zone (unzoned files are unrestricted; combine with `coverage.requireAllFiles` to force zoning first), and the check matches direct callee paths only (optional chaining included), so it does not follow aliased or re-bound callees (`const run = cp.exec; run()`), computed members, or injected dependencies (`this.client.exec()` will not match `child_process.*`). Findings share the `boundary-violation` rule severity and suppression token; the rule-id-shaped `boundary-call-violation` token is accepted as an alias, and either token suppresses the whole boundary family.

Forbidden-call findings inherit the `boundary-violation` rule, which defaults to `error` and fails CI on the first matching call. For a staged rollout, start with `"rules": { "boundary-violation": "warn" }` while you triage existing violations, then switch back to `error` to enforce.

To encode project policy that is not tied to architecture zones, list declarative rule packs. A rule pack is a standalone JSON or JSONC file of `banned-call`, `banned-import`, and `banned-effect` rules, loaded as pure data (no project code ever executes):

```jsonc
// .fallowrc.json
{ "rulePacks": ["./rule-packs/team-policy.jsonc"] }
```

Authoring loop:

```bash
fallow rule-pack init --template ai-safe-repo
fallow rule-pack list
fallow rule-pack test rule-packs/team-policy.jsonc
fallow dead-code --policy-violations
```

`fallow rule-pack init` scaffolds starter, AI-safe repo, side-effect-free
domain, clean architecture, and Next.js App Router templates. It wires the pack
into the local config when possible and prints the snippet when manual editing
is safer. Use `fallow rule-pack list --format json` to inspect loaded packs and
effective severities, then iterate with `fallow rule-pack test`: test always
exits 0 when analysis succeeds, lists zero-finding rules, and leaves CI gating
to `fallow dead-code --policy-violations`.

```jsonc
// rule-packs/team-policy.jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "team-policy",
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "no-child-process",
      "kind": "banned-call",
      "callees": ["child_process.*"],
      "message": "Use the sandboxed runner instead.",
      "severity": "error"
    },
    {
      "id": "no-moment",
      "kind": "banned-import",
      "specifiers": ["moment"],
      "message": "Use date-fns."
    },
    {
      "id": "no-network",
      "kind": "banned-effect",
      "effects": ["network"],
      "message": "Keep this package side-effect free."
    }
  ]
}
```

Matches report as `policy-violation` findings identified by `<pack>/<rule-id>` across every output format. `banned-call` matching is segment-aware and import-resolved like `boundaries.calls.forbidden`, so `child_process.*` covers named, namespace, and default imports from `child_process` and `node:child_process`; bare patterns like `fetch` match globals by their written path. `banned-import` matches the RAW specifier segment-aware: `moment` covers `moment` and `moment/locale/nl` but never `moment-timezone`, and aliased or rewritten specifiers (for example Deno-style `npm:moment`) are not matched, so list the form your code actually writes. `banned-effect` matches call sites whose callee is known by the internal security catalogue and whose catalogue row carries one of the listed effects: `pure`, `read`, `write`, `network`, `storage`, `process`, `shell`, `crypto`, `randomness`, `dom`, `database`, `framework-callback`, or `unknown`. Effect matching uses the same written plus import-resolved canonical callee path as `banned-call`; framework-gated catalogue rows only apply when the project declares the enabling dependency. Rules scope with optional `files` / `exclude` globs, skip type-only imports with `"ignoreTypeOnly": true`, and carry an optional per-rule `severity`. The `rules."policy-violation"` master defaults to `warn` so a new pack never hard-fails CI on its first run; opt individual rules up with `"severity": "error"` once triaged (`off` on the master is a kill switch for the whole evaluator). The exit-code gate reads the effective per-finding severity, so one error-severity rule fails the run even under a warn master. Suppress one rule with `// fallow-ignore-next-line policy-violation:<pack>/<rule-id>` or `// fallow-ignore-file policy-violation:<pack>/<rule-id>`. Use bare `policy-violation` only when you intend to suppress every rule-pack finding at that line or file scope. Pack names and rule ids must use ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, or `-` so scoped tokens are unambiguous. When several rules in scope could match the same usage, `banned-call` and `banned-effect` report one finding per unique callee path (the first applicable rule in config order wins, mirroring `boundaries.calls.forbidden`), while `banned-import` reports one finding per matching rule, since each rule carries its own message and severity. Keep pack files in a committed directory such as `rule-packs/`; `.fallow/` is the gitignored cache directory, so packs stored there silently vanish from teammates' checkouts. Run `fallow rule-pack schema` to print the pack JSON Schema for editor autocomplete; `fallow rule-pack-schema` remains a legacy alias. Invalid packs (unknown rule kind, missing file, inert pattern, ambiguous names, duplicate ids) fail config load instead of silently enforcing nothing. Rule packs are and will stay pure data: if a future version ever adds executable checks, they will sit behind an explicit trust opt-in, never default-on.

Run `fallow list --boundaries` to inspect the expanded rules. TOML also supported (`fallow init --toml`). The init command auto-detects your project structure (monorepo layout, frameworks, existing config) and generates a tailored config. It also adds `.fallow/` to your `.gitignore` (cache and local data). Use `fallow init --agents` to scaffold a starter `AGENTS.md` with project-specific guidance for coding agents. Scaffold a pre-commit `fallow audit` hook with `fallow hooks install --target git`; the hook uses the current branch upstream as its base and falls back to `--branch` (or the detected default branch) when no upstream is set. For agent gates, use `fallow hooks install --target agent`. Migrating from knip or jscpd? Run `fallow migrate`.

Use `ignoreUnresolvedImports` for generated or runtime-provided import specifiers that fallow cannot resolve. Patterns match the raw import string, not a filesystem path: list both `@example/icons` and `@example/icons/**` when you need the bare package and its subpaths. Parent-relative generated specifiers such as `../generated/**` are allowed. Keep patterns narrow, since broad values like `**` can hide real missing modules. This setting affects only `unresolved-import` findings; it does not change dependency usage or resolver behavior.

## Editor and agent integrations

Fallow is not an AI assistant. It is the deterministic codebase intelligence layer that your assistant, your editor, and your CI pipeline can call.

- **Editor integrations** -- VS Code extension, Zed extension, and Neovim LSP setup ([editors](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/tree/main/editors))
- **LSP server** -- real-time diagnostics, hover info, code actions, Code Lens with reference counts
- **Agent Skill + MCP server** -- version-matched AI agent guidance ships in the npm package, with MCP integration for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and other agents ([fallow-skills](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow-skills))
- **MCP Code Mode** -- `code_execute` composes read-only analysis calls in a bounded JavaScript sandbox, without filesystem, network, shell, or fix-apply access
- **JSON `actions` array** -- every issue in `--format json` output includes fix suggestions with `auto_fixable` flag, so agents can self-correct
- **Typed output contract** -- `import type { CheckOutput } from "fallow/types"` version-pinned to your installed CLI
- **Opt-in telemetry controls** -- `fallow telemetry status|inspect|enable|disable`, with agent-source attribution through `FALLOW_AGENT_SOURCE`

## Performance

Benchmarked on real open-source projects, cold runs (no cache) so each tool works from scratch. The benchmark scripts print exact tool and environment versions for reproducible local runs. Fastest tool per row in bold.

### Dead code: fallow vs knip

| Project | Files | fallow | knip | Faster |
|:--------|------:|-------:|-----:|-------:|
| [astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) | 2,859 | 3.76s | **1.21s** | knip 3.1x |
| [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) | 286 | **64ms** | 205ms | fallow 3.2x |
| [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) | 20,558 | 2.95s | errors* | fallow only |
| [preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) | 244 | **74ms** | 2.01s | fallow 27.1x |
| [TanStack/query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) | 901 | **560ms** | 1.04s | fallow 1.9x |
| [svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) | 3,337 | **611ms** | 632ms | fallow 1.0x |
| [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) | 38,146 | 2.22s | **736ms** | knip 3.0x |
| [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) | 1,420 | 595ms | errors* | fallow only |
| [vue/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) | 522 | 138ms | errors* | fallow only |
| [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) | 174 | **47ms** | 279ms | fallow 5.9x |

\* knip exits without valid output on next.js, vite, and vue/core (it fails loading those projects' own config files); fallow analyzes them.

fallow is faster on the small-to-mid projects in this set (fastify, preact, query, svelte, zod), while current knip is faster on astro and TypeScript. fallow's edge is doing more in one tool, not always raw dead-code speed, and it analyzes the three projects knip cannot load here. fallow's persistent cache makes repeat (warm) runs faster again; the table uses the conservative cold numbers.

### Duplication: fallow vs jscpd

Cold median of 3 measured runs. `Clone groups` and `Dup %` come from each tool's own report, so they are useful for scale but not a byte-for-byte equivalence check.

| Project | Files | fallow | jscpd | Faster | fallow clone groups | fallow dup % | jscpd clone groups | jscpd dup % |
|:--------|------:|-------:|------:|-------:|--------------------:|-------------:|-------------------:|------------:|
| [astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) | 2,859 | 549ms | **189ms** | jscpd 2.9x | 1,242 | 16.3% | 1,494 | 9.7% |
| [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) | 286 | 90ms | **64ms** | jscpd 1.4x | 1,128 | 39.0% | 1,131 | 23.5% |
| [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) | 20,552 | 12.66s | **861ms** | jscpd 14.7x | 4,485 | 26.3% | 7,287 | 16.4% |
| [preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) | 244 | 58ms | **49ms** | jscpd 1.2x | 368 | 20.2% | 421 | 12.3% |
| [TanStack/query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) | 901 | 133ms | **96ms** | jscpd 1.4x | 1,084 | 32.7% | 1,237 | 19.4% |
| [svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) | 3,337 | 317ms | **172ms** | jscpd 1.8x | 528 | 13.6% | 658 | 9.1% |
| [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) | 38,146 | 13.45s | **4.58s** | jscpd 2.9x | 2,749 | 26.9% | 51,158 | 45.8% |
| [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) | 1,420 | 174ms | **74ms** | jscpd 2.3x | 219 | 13.6% | 260 | 5.1% |
| [vue/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) | 522 | 109ms | **78ms** | jscpd 1.4x | 864 | 15.7% | 696 | 6.9% |
| [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) | 174 | 54ms | **53ms** | jscpd 1.0x | 78 | 94.1% | 140 | 49.6% |

jscpd remains faster for raw duplication scanning on these projects. fallow's duplication checker runs inside the broader audit flow, alongside dead code, dependency, complexity, CSS, framework, and security checks.

No TypeScript compiler, no Node.js runtime needed to analyze your code. [Fallow vs linters](https://docs.fallow.tools/explanations/fallow-vs-linters) | [Reproduce benchmarks](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/tree/main/benchmarks)

## Suppressing findings

```ts
// fallow-ignore-next-line unused-export -- kept for plugin consumers
export const keepThis = 1;

// fallow-ignore-next-line unused-export, complexity -- public API shim
export const publicComplexHelper = (value: number) => value;

// fallow-ignore-file -- generated route map
// Suppress all issues in this file
```

Use a comma-separated issue-kind list when one line has multiple findings. The `-- <reason>` suffix is optional by default and is recorded in suppression hygiene output. Set `rules.require-suppression-reason` to `"warn"` or `"error"` to require a reason on every `fallow-ignore-*` comment and `@expected-unused` tag.

Also supports JSDoc visibility tags (`/** @public */`, `/** @internal */`, `/** @beta */`, `/** @alpha */`) to suppress unused export reports for library APIs consumed externally. Use `/** @expected-unused -- <reason> */` when an export is intentionally unused today but should be reported once it becomes used.

Set `ignoreExportsUsedInFile: true` when exported helpers should stay quiet while another symbol in the same file still references them, but should be reported once they become completely unreferenced. The `{ "type": true, "interface": true }` object form is accepted for knip parity; fallow groups type aliases and interfaces under one issue, so both type-kind fields behave identically. References inside the export specifier itself (`export { foo }`, `export default foo`) do not count as same-file uses.

## Limitations

fallow uses syntactic analysis -- no type information. This is what makes it fast and deterministic, but findings that require a type-checker (cross-module type narrowing, conditional types, type-level reachability) are out of scope. Use [inline suppression comments](#suppressing-findings) or [`ignoreExports`](https://docs.fallow.tools/configuration/overview#ignoring-specific-exports) for edge cases.
