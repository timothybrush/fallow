---

Most repositories carry code nobody dares to delete, because deleting means proving a negative: fallow reads the repository as one dependency graph, from import edges to styling tokens, and reports what that graph shows.

```
Audit scope: 19 changed files vs HEAD~15 (8fbfcb054..HEAD)

● Unused files (2)
  packages/vitest/src/public/reporters.ts
  test/coverage-test/test/configuration-options.test-d.ts

● Circular dependencies (6)
  packages/vitest/src/integrations/vi.ts
    → wait.ts → vi.ts

✗ dead code: 156 issues · complexity: 6 findings · duplication: 8 clone groups · 19 changed files (1.05s)
  audit gate excluded 163 inherited findings (run with --gate all to enforce)
```

*Excerpt from `fallow audit` on the vitest monorepo, auditing its last 15 commits. fallow 3.5.0, warm base-snapshot cache. The gate passed: the 163 inherited findings are pre-existing and excluded by design, so they do not block the change. The same run with `--format json` returns one typed JSON document.*

## Quick start

```bash
# Zero-install, full pipeline (dead code + duplication + health)
npx fallow

# Gate only what a PR changed
npx fallow audit

# Install as a devDependency
npm install --save-dev fallow

# For agents and scripts: exit 0 and 1 both mean the run succeeded (1 = findings);
# exit 2 is a real error, reported as a JSON envelope on stdout
npx fallow audit --format json --quiet 2>/dev/null
```

The npm package ships the `fallow`, `fallow-lsp`, and `fallow-mcp` launchers plus a version-matched agent skill, so the editor and agent integrations resolve the project-local binary instead of whatever happens to be on `PATH`. Runs are deterministic: the same input produces the same output with stable fingerprints. Re-running to verify an edit is safe. Other channels (pnpm, yarn, `cargo install fallow-cli`, and a local Docker build with a Compose example at [`examples/docker/compose.yaml`](examples/docker/compose.yaml)) are covered in the [installation guide](https://docs.fallow.tools/installation).

## What fallow reports

- [Unused files, exports, types, enum and class members, and dependencies](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/dead-code)
- [Circular dependencies and re-export cycles](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/dead-code), part of `fallow dead-code`
- [Code duplication](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/duplication) with a suffix-array detector covering JS/TS and CSS-family stylesheets, plus Vue/Svelte/Astro component regions
- [Complexity hotspots](https://docs.fallow.tools/explanations/health) and a 0 to 100 health score with a letter grade
- [Architecture boundary violations](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/boundaries) with `bulletproof`, `layered`, `hexagonal`, and `feature-sliced` presets
- [Design-system styling drift](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/css-analysis) for CSS and CSS-in-JS
- [A changed-file PR gate](https://docs.fallow.tools/cli/audit) with a pass, warn, or fail verdict (`fallow audit`)
- [Auto-fix](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/auto-fix) with a dry-run preview
- Opt-in [security candidates](docs/security-agent-verification.md) ranked by reachability from entry points (`fallow security`)

Over 100 built-in [framework plugins](https://docs.fallow.tools/frameworks/built-in) detect entry points automatically, so the first run needs no configuration. Fallow Runtime, the optional paid layer, merges production execution evidence into these same reports; see [Runtime intelligence (optional)](#runtime-intelligence-optional) and [static vs runtime](https://docs.fallow.tools/explanations/static-vs-runtime).

## Your first run

Findings on a first run usually mean fallow is missing an entry point or a framework convention, or is analyzing generated files you never meant to include. The built-in plugins take care of framework detection; it's generated code that usually needs a hint:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/fallow/schema.json",
  "ignorePatterns": ["**/*.generated.ts"]
}
```

You do not have to author that config yourself. [`npx fallow recommend`](https://docs.fallow.tools/cli/recommend) detects the stack (frameworks, workspace layout, test runner, package manager), prints a proposed config as a safe starting point, and ends with the few genuinely subjective choices it will not decide for you. It is read-only and always exits 0; nothing changes until you save the config.

Patterns are relative to the project root and add to fallow's built-in ignore defaults (node_modules, dist, coverage, minified bundles). Config precedence is first match wins per directory, with no merging: `.fallowrc.json` (JSONC accepted) > `.fallowrc.jsonc` > `fallow.toml` > `.fallow.toml`. The full reference is the [configuration overview](https://docs.fallow.tools/configuration/overview); known limits (syntactic analysis, no type resolution) are documented in [limitations](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/limitations); for a hung or failed run, see [debugging](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/debugging).

Adopting on an existing codebase? `fallow audit` fails only on findings a change introduces, so a legacy backlog does not block day one, and `--save-baseline` / `--baseline` quarantine the existing findings for the standalone commands. The [adoption guide](https://docs.fallow.tools/adoption) covers the staged path.

</details>

Per-command flags come from `fallow schema` (machine-readable) or the [CLI reference](https://docs.fallow.tools/cli/global-flags).

## Output and exit codes

For machine consumption, add `--format json --quiet` to any command, parse the JSON on stdout, and do not depend on whitespace. JSON is compact by default; add `--pretty` only for manual inspection. Exit 0 and 1 both mean the run succeeded (1 signals findings); exit 2 is a real error and still writes a JSON envelope to stdout. Branch on the code, treating 0 and 1 as success and 2 as failure, rather than blanket-suppressing with `|| true` (which hides real errors from anything that checks the exit code).

| `--format` | What you get |
|---|---|
| `human` (default) | Terminal report with a `Next:` suggestion line |
| `json` | The machine contract: one compact typed JSON document on stdout (`--pretty` indents it) |
| `sarif` | GitHub Code Scanning and other SARIF consumers |
| `compact` | One grep-friendly line per finding |
| `markdown` (`md` accepted via `FALLOW_FORMAT`) | Markdown report |
| `codeclimate` (aliases `gitlab-codequality`, `gitlab-code-quality`) | GitLab Code Quality report |
| `github-annotations` | Workflow-command annotations; render on fork PRs without a write token |
| `github-summary` | Job-summary markdown for `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` |
| `pr-comment-github`, `pr-comment-gitlab`, `review-github`, `review-gitlab` | Typed CI feedback envelopes for the bundled CI scripts |
| `badge` | shields.io-compatible SVG health badge; `fallow health` only (`fallow health --format badge > badge.svg`) |

`human`, `json`, `sarif`, `compact`, and `markdown` apply to every analysis command; the CI envelopes and `badge` belong to the command that produces them, as documented per format in the [CI guide](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/ci).

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Clean, or audit verdict pass or warn |
| 1 | Findings, or audit verdict fail (a normal outcome) |
| 2 | Validation or runtime error (JSON error envelope on stdout with `--format json`) |
| 7 | Network failure (license and cloud operations) |
| 8 | Security gate hit (`fallow security --gate`) |

Rule severity maps onto exit codes: `error` fails CI (the default), `warn` exits 0, `off` skips the rule ([rules reference](https://docs.fallow.tools/configuration/rules)).

The JSON contract, in short:

- a root `kind` discriminator names the analysis that produced the document
- per-issue `actions[]` with an `auto_fixable` flag, so a script knows which findings it can hand to `fallow fix`
- root `next_steps[]` suggestions are runnable as-is
- errors arrive as `{"error": true, "message": "...", "exit_code": 2}` on stdout, not as a stack trace

Typed contracts ship with the npm package: `import type { CheckOutput, FallowJsonOutput } from "fallow/types"`. The generated schema lives at [docs/output-schema.json](docs/output-schema.json). The output format is CLI-only, via `--format` or `FALLOW_FORMAT`, and is never set in config; all environment variables are listed in [docs/environment-variables.md](docs/environment-variables.md).

## Built for agents

The JSON contract and exit codes above are the agent interface.

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "fallow": { "command": "npx", "args": ["fallow-mcp"] } } }
```

The [MCP server](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/mcp) covers analysis, audit, health, duplication, tracing, fix preview and apply, boundary guard checks, and target inspection; every tool documents its nearest CLI fallback, and a bounded read-only Code Mode sandbox composes analysis calls without filesystem or network access.

- [`npx fallow recommend --format json`](https://docs.fallow.tools/cli/recommend) is the onboarding entry point: it returns the detected stack, a proposed config, and every decision with its tier and rationale, and it ships the subjective choices as ready-to-ask questions with options and tradeoffs. An agent authors `.fallowrc.json` from evidence and asks the user only what fallow will not decide
- A version-matched agent skill ships in the npm package under `node_modules/fallow/skills/fallow` ([agent skills](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/agent-skills), companion repo [fallow-skills](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow-skills))
- `npx fallow init --agents` scaffolds an AGENTS.md with a task-to-command matrix
- `npx fallow hooks install --target agent` gates `git commit` and `git push` on `fallow audit` ([hooks](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/claude-hooks))
- A compliance loop with a copy-paste agent prompt: [docs/fallow-compliance.md](docs/fallow-compliance.md)
- To verify security candidates from an agent harness, follow [docs/security-agent-verification.md](docs/security-agent-verification.md)
- Never run `fallow watch` in an agent loop; it does not exit. Telemetry is off by default and opt-in only, with `DO_NOT_TRACK` honored ([docs/telemetry.md](docs/telemetry.md))

## Suppressing findings

```ts
// fallow-ignore-next-line unused-export -- kept for plugin consumers
export const keepThis = 1;
```

`// fallow-ignore-file <issue-type>` suppresses the whole file. Both marker forms take a comma-separated list of issue kinds and an optional `-- <reason>` suffix that suppression hygiene records. JSDoc visibility tags (`@public`, `@internal`, `@expected-unused -- <reason>`) keep intentional library API surface quiet. `fallow suppressions` prints the inventory.

For staged [adoption](https://docs.fallow.tools/adoption), save a baseline once from a clean ref with `--save-baseline`, then pass `--baseline` on every run; `fallow audit` accepts per-analysis baselines. Full syntax lives at [suppression](https://docs.fallow.tools/configuration/suppression).

## CI

GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
- uses: fallow-rs/fallow@v3
```

The Action defaults to the full pipeline with PR-scoped analysis via automatic base detection, and it is a blocking gate out of the box: `fail-on-issues` defaults to true, so any finding fails the job. For a staged rollout, start report-only with `fail-on-issues: false`, or use `command: audit` so only findings a PR introduces can fail CI. A SARIF file is generated by default but uploading it to GitHub Code Scanning is opt-in (`sarif: true` plus `permissions: security-events: write`); inline annotations render without any of that. The `@v3` tag floats within major version 3; pin an exact tag when the fleet needs reproducible runs. Sticky comments and review comments are inputs documented in the [CI guide](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/ci).

GitLab:

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fallow-rs/fallow/v3.6.0/ci/gitlab-ci.yml'

fallow:
  extends: .fallow
```

MR comments need a `GITLAB_TOKEN` with api scope; `CI_JOB_TOKEN` cannot create notes. Runners that cannot reach GitHub raw can vendor the template with `npx fallow ci-template gitlab --vendor`.

CI runs diff-scoped on pull requests by default, so CI output can legitimately differ from a full local run. Commit baseline files to keep CI and local in agreement.

## Runtime intelligence (optional)

Fallow Runtime is the optional paid layer. It merges production execution evidence (V8 coverage dumps via `NODE_V8_COVERAGE`, or Istanbul files) into `fallow health` and `fallow audit`: hot paths for careful review, cold-code deletion confidence, runtime-weighted health, and stale-flag evidence. A single local coverage capture is free; continuous and cloud runtime monitoring requires a license. Everything else in this README is free and needs no license.

```bash
npx fallow license activate --trial --email you@company.com   # 30-day trial, offline Ed25519 verification
npx fallow coverage setup                                     # resumable first-run flow
```

Details: [runtime coverage](https://docs.fallow.tools/analysis/runtime-coverage) and [static vs runtime](https://docs.fallow.tools/explanations/static-vs-runtime).

## Editors and integrations

- [VS Code extension](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/vscode)
- Zed and Neovim setups under the [`editors/`](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/tree/main/editors) tree ([Neovim guide](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/neovim))
- The `fallow-lsp` server: diagnostics, hover, code actions, and code lenses. It resolves the project-local binary from a devDependency install
- The Node API [`@fallow-cli/fallow-node`](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/node-bindings) exports `detectDeadCode`, `detectDuplication`, and `computeHealth`
- [README badges](https://docs.fallow.tools/integrations/badges): `fallow health --format badge > badge.svg`

## Migrating from other tools

`npx fallow migrate` translates existing knip, jscpd, or stylelint configuration into a fallow config. Guides: [from knip](https://docs.fallow.tools/migration/from-knip), [from jscpd](https://docs.fallow.tools/migration/from-jscpd), and the [comparison page](https://docs.fallow.tools/migration/comparison).

## Performance

On the dead-code benchmark set, fallow analyzes fastify in 64ms where knip 6 takes 205ms, and preact in 74ms against 2.01s (27.1x). The counterweight is real too: knip measures faster on astro and TypeScript, and jscpd remains faster at raw duplication scanning. fallow also completes analysis on three projects in the set where knip's runs errored on those projects' own config files (next.js at 20,558 files, vite, and vue/core).

Measured on fallow 2.100.0 (the most recent full benchmark capture), Apple M5, medians of 5 cold runs. Methodology, full tables, and reproduction scripts live in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) and [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/); rerun them against any version. For how fallow relates to lint tooling, see [fallow vs linters](https://docs.fallow.tools/explanations/fallow-vs-linters).
