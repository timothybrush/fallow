# Fallow Roadmap

> This roadmap covers planned work and is reviewed periodically. For shipped capabilities, see the [releases](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/releases) and [documentation](https://docs.fallow.tools).

This roadmap tracks planned work on Fallow: what is queued, what is being scoped, and where the project is headed.

---

## Next

Concrete work scoped to the next one or two minor releases.

### Richer MCP responses

The `inspect_target` tool already combines re-export chains, importers, duplicate siblings, and optional recent churn into one evidence bundle. The remaining work is to bring the same decision-ready context to broader MCP analysis flows where agents currently have to follow up with a separate inspection call.

### Coverage sidecar ergonomics

The coverage setup state machine works end to end, but the install handoff still depends on users trusting a download. Target: reproducible sidecar pinning, smoother framework recipe generation, clearer failure messages when the sidecar cannot attach.

### Post-fix formatter integration

`fallow fix` leaves Prettier, dprint, or Biome to clean up whitespace after removals. Invoke the project's configured formatter automatically when running in-place.

### Per-package `changedSince` overrides

Monorepos with packages on different release cadences want different baseline refs per package (e.g. `packages/web` tracks `main`, `packages/legacy` tracks `release/2024.10`). Today `fallow.changedSince` is workspace-wide. Extending this to per-package overrides requires config-schema work (a new `[overrides]` block keyed on workspace root, or `package.json` field), resolution semantics (which baseline wins for a file in package A imported from package B), and matching status-bar logic.

## Vision

Broader bets, still being scoped.

### Agent-driven cleanup loop

Safe removals (unused exports, enum members, dependencies) are already auto-fixable. The open question is the judgment calls: deleting files, consolidating duplicates, restructuring modules. The bet: structured MCP output plus the right review workflow lets an agent propose those changes, a human approves the PR, and fallow verifies nothing regressed.

### Health score calibration and adoption

Shipped today: `fallow health` provides a 0-100 score, an A-F letter grade,
badge output, saved vital-sign snapshots, and trend comparisons. Planned work
focuses on calibrating the formula against a broad real-world corpus, explaining
how its multiple signals contribute to each result, and helping teams adopt
baselines and thresholds that fit their project context. This direction improves
confidence and multi-signal explainability rather than adding another grade.

---

## Ongoing

Continuous work across releases.

- **Incremental analysis** -- finer-grained caching for faster watch mode and CI on large monorepos
- **Plugin ecosystem** -- more framework coverage, better external plugin authoring, community-contributed plugins
- **Health intelligence** -- structured fix suggestions, HTML report cards, richer regression diffing
- **Agent integration** -- Cursor integration, expanded MCP coverage, new editor surfaces beyond VS Code and Zed

---

## Known limitations

Acknowledged gaps. Fixes land opportunistically.

- **Syntactic analysis only** -- no TypeScript type information. Projects using `isolatedModules: true` (the modern default) are well-served; legacy tsc-only patterns may produce false positives.
- **Config parsing ceiling** -- AST-based extraction handles static configs. Computed values and conditionals are out of reach without JS eval.
- **Svelte export false negatives** -- props (`export let`) can't be distinguished from utility exports without Svelte compiler semantics.
- **NestJS/DI class members** -- abstract methods consumed via DI are not tracked. Use `unused_class_members = "off"` for DI-heavy projects.
