# Shared drift guard: every canonical dead-code IssueKind must surface in the
# jq summary / annotation / filter tables that are supposed to carry the full
# dead-code set. A new fallow IssueKind that is not wired into one of those
# surfaces would otherwise vanish silently from PR/MR output (the class of gap
# this guard exists to catch). It gates ALL such surfaces, not just
# summary-check.jq:
#
#   action/jq/summary-check.jq      (all)   GitHub dead-code summary table
#   action/jq/summary-combined.jq   (all)   GitHub combined Code-issues breakdown
#   action/jq/summary-audit.jq      (all)   GitHub audit dead_code_rows
#   action/jq/annotations-check.jq  (all)   GitHub ::warning annotations
#   action/jq/filter-changed.jq     (all)   per-changed-file filter + recount
#   ci/jq/summary-check.jq          (all)   GitLab dead-code summary table
#   ci/jq/summary-combined.jq       (all)   GitLab combined Code-issues breakdown
#   ci/jq/summary-audit.jq          (all)   GitLab audit dead_code_rows
#
# Sourced by both action/tests/run.sh and ci/tests/run.sh. Relies on the
# `pass` / `fail` helpers defined by the sourcing runner, plus `$GUARD_DIR`
# (the directory containing this script) being set by the caller.
#
# Canonical set: the dead-code issue-type ids from `fallow schema`
# (issue_types[].command == "dead-code"). When the binary is unavailable the
# fallback derives the kebab ids from crates/types/src/suppress.rs
# `issue_kind_to_kebab` instead. Either source is mapped to the snake_case
# plural JSON result key the surfaces reference.
#
# Non-dead-code kinds (security-*, code-duplication, complexity, coverage-gaps,
# feature-flag) are NOT summarised by these dead-code surfaces: they belong to
# the dupes / health / flags / security surfaces. They have no mapping entry
# and are reported as deliberate skips rather than failures.
#
# Per-surface expectation. Each surface declares whether it SHOULD carry every
# dead-code kind ("all") or a documented subset. A surface keyed "all" fails
# the moment any canonical kind is absent. A subset surface lists the kebab ids
# it is permitted to omit; those ids are skipped (reported, never failed) while
# every OTHER kind is still gated. This means a brand-new 38th IssueKind that
# fails to reach a subset surface STILL fails the guard; only the explicitly
# enumerated, documented omissions are tolerated.

# Deterministic kebab-id -> summary-check.jq JSON key. Irregular pluralisation
# (catalog-entry -> catalog_entries, boundary-coverage -> *_violations) makes a
# mechanical s/-/_/+pluralise unsafe, so the mapping is explicit. A dead-code id
# with no entry here FAILS the guard, forcing this table to grow in lockstep
# with the IssueKind enum.
