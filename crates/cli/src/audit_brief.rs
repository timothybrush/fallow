//! `fallow audit --brief` (alias `fallow review`): a deterministic rendering
//! mode layered over the existing audit analysis.
//!
//! The brief answers "where do I look?" rather than "will CI block this?". It
//! is composition + rendering over the same [`crate::audit::AuditResult`] that
//! drives `fallow audit`; it runs no new analysis and, critically, ALWAYS exits
//! 0 so a reviewer or agent can read the orientation even when the underlying
//! audit verdict is `fail`. The verdict is still computed and carried in the
//! brief JSON informationally, but it never drives the exit code on this path.
//!
//! The JSON envelope is an independently-versioned
//! [`crate::output_envelope::FallowOutput::AuditBrief`] variant
//! (`kind: "audit-brief"`) so the brief shape evolves on its own cadence
//! without bumping the main `--format json` contract.
