//! Weighted focus map (stage 4): a COMPOSITE attention score per review unit
//! that ranks where scarce reviewer attention goes.
//!
//! A 40-file diff becomes a handful of `review-here` pieces plus an enumerable
//! `not-prioritized` remainder. The free tier RANKS but NEVER says "skip" (safe
//! explicit-skip is paid, runtime-backed only); each unit carries a human
//! reason; a per-unit confidence flag protects dynamically-wired / re-export-heavy
//! code from a silent static-reachability de-prioritization; and the
//! `deprioritized` escape-hatch list makes EVERY de-prioritized piece reachable.
//!
//! ## The composite score (deterministic, no runtime input)
//!
//! `score = fan_io + security_taint + risk_zone + change_shape`, an integer sum
//! (no floats, matching the partition + order engine's determinism posture) of four deterministic signals,
//! each derived from data the brief already retains:
//!
//! 1. **fan-in / fan-out** (graph blast): from `ModuleGraph::focus_file_facts`.
//! 2. **security taint touch**: a source -> sink taint trace touches the unit
//!    (reuse `SecurityFinding.trace`). Built as a pure function of a security-
//!    finding slice; the brief path carries an EMPTY slice today (security is the
//!    opt-in `fallow security` command, not the bare dead-code analysis), so this
//!    contributes 0 until a future epic threads a security pass. The seam is wired
//!    and tested; no taint engine runs here.
//! 3. **risk zone**: boundary / public-API / security-sensitive.
//! 4. **change shape**: new export / widened visibility / signature change (the
//!    coordination-gap proxy, ADR-001 syntactic).
//!
//! ## The runtime seam (documented, NOT built)
//!
//! `FocusScore` keeps the four component sub-scores on the wire so the paid
//! runtime layer can multiply a runtime hot/cold weight into `total` WITHOUT recomputing the
//! deterministic signals. The single `// runtime seam` marker sits at the point the
//! components are summed. No runtime field, no runtime read, no runtime gate here:
//! free mode is the complete surface.
