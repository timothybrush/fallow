//! Agent-contract loop (the codiff pattern, graph-extended).
//!
//! Closes the steer-the-agent loop. The tool owns the digest + prompt + schema;
//! the agent owns judgment; fallow post-validates the agent's judgment against
//! the LIVE graph + diff. The reentry is the `--walkthrough-file` path, exactly
//! as codiff re-resolves hunk ids against the live diff at validation time, but
//! fallow's verifier is the deterministic module graph, not a second model.
//!
//! ## LEAD PRINCIPLE: the verifier is the graph, not a second model
//!
//! Trust comes from deterministic, reproducible, graph-adjudicated post-validation
//! that cannot hallucinate. Two mechanisms enforce it:
//!
//! 1. **Anti-hallucination** (anchoring): every agent judgment MUST cite a
//!    `signal_id` fallow emitted.
//!    [`DecisionSurface::accept_signal_id`](crate::audit_decision_surface::DecisionSurface::accept_signal_id)
//!    is the allowlist; a judgment whose id was never emitted is REJECTED. The
//!    agent proposes; the graph disposes.
//! 2. **Staleness refusal** (snapshot pin): the digest (the `WalkthroughGuide`)
//!    carries a deterministic `graph_snapshot_hash`, a stable hash of the
//!    relevant graph + diff state. The agent echoes it back in its JSON; if the
//!    tree moved between the guide emission and the reentry, the current hash
//!    differs and the WHOLE payload is REFUSED as stale.
//!
//! ## Injection-resistance by construction
//!
//! The digest is built ONLY from the deterministic graph
//! ([`crate::audit_brief::build_brief_output`], pure over the tree). PR prose
//! NEVER enters the digest. On reentry, the agent's free-text framing is FENCED
//! (marked non-deterministic) onto the validation output; it never gates, never
//! auto-posts, and never folds back into the digest. Treat any PR prose fed to an
//! agent as untrusted: this loop is injection-resistant because the trusted
//! surface is the graph, and the untrusted surface is fenced.
