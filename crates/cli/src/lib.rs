Analysis:
  dead-code      Analyze unused code, dependency hygiene, and architecture cycles
  dupes          Find copy-paste and structural code duplication
  health         Analyze complexity, maintainability, hotspots, and coverage gaps
  flags          Detect feature flag usage patterns
  security       Surface local security candidates for agent verification (opt-in)
  audit          Review changed files for dead code, complexity, duplication, and styling

Workflow:
  watch          Re-run analysis as files change
  fix            Auto-fix safe unused-code findings

Project inspection:
  list           List discovered files, entry points, plugins, boundaries, and workspaces
  inspect        Inspect one file or exported symbol as a bundled evidence query
  workspaces     Show monorepo workspace discovery diagnostics
  explain        Explain one issue type without running analysis
  suppressions   List active fallow-ignore suppression markers
  impact         Show what fallow has done for you (opt-in, local-only)
  viz            Generate an interactive HTML map of the codebase

Setup and configuration:
  init              Create a fallow config, optionally with a Git hook
  audit-cache       Maintain reusable audit base-snapshot caches
  recommend         Recommend a project-tailored config for an agent to author
  migrate           Migrate knip, jscpd, or stylelint config to fallow

  config-schema     Print the fallow config JSON Schema
  plugin-schema     Print the external plugin JSON Schema
  plugin-check      Dry-run external plugins and report what they seed
  rule-pack-schema  Print the rule pack JSON Schema

Automation and CI:
  ci             Build PR/MR feedback envelopes
  ci-template    Print or vendor CI integration templates
  report         Re-render a saved --format json results file (GitHub formats)
  hooks          Install or remove fallow-managed Git and agent hooks

  telemetry      Manage opt-in product telemetry

Reference:
  schema         Dump the CLI interface as machine-readable JSON
  help           Print this message or the help of a command
