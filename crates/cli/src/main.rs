Analysis:
  dead-code      Analyze unused code, dependency hygiene, and architecture cycles
  dupes          Find copy-paste and structural code duplication
  health         Analyze complexity, maintainability, hotspots, and coverage gaps
  flags          Detect feature flag usage patterns
  security       Surface local security candidates for agent verification (opt-in)
  audit          Review changed files for dead code, complexity, and duplication

Workflow:
  watch          Re-run analysis as files change
  fix            Auto-fix safe unused-code findings

Project inspection:
  list           List discovered files, entry points, plugins, boundaries, and workspaces
  workspaces     Show monorepo workspace discovery diagnostics
  explain        Explain one issue type without running analysis
  impact         Show what fallow has done for you (opt-in, local-only)

Setup and configuration:
  init              Create a fallow config, optionally with a Git hook
  migrate           Migrate knip or jscpd config to fallow
  config            Show the resolved config and loaded config file
  config-schema     Print the fallow config JSON Schema
  plugin-schema     Print the external plugin JSON Schema

  setup-hooks    Legacy agent-hook installer

Runtime coverage:
  coverage       Set up or analyze runtime coverage data
  license        Manage the paid-feature license
  telemetry      Manage opt-in product telemetry

Reference:
  schema         Dump the CLI interface as machine-readable JSON
  help           Print this message or the help of a command
