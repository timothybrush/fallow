//! Human terminal renderer for `fallow review --walkthrough`.
//!
//! Renders the EXISTING [`StandardWalkthroughGuide`] (already built by
//! `crate::audit_walkthrough::build_guide_from_result`) as a staged, codiff-style
//! review tour. This module is a PURE line-builder over the in-memory guide; it
//! reads no JSON and performs no IO, so it is unit-testable and the entry point
//! in `audit_brief.rs` owns the stdout/stderr split and the viewed-state IO.
//!
//! ## Stages
//!
//! The guide has no literal stage array, so two ordered stages are synthesized
//! from `direction.units` partitioned by `concern_lens`, preserving
//! `direction.order` within each:
//!   - **Stage 1, affects code outside this PR** (`concern_lens == "contract-break"`):
//!     units with out-of-diff consumers.
//!   - **Stage 2, self-contained** (the rest): units with no out-of-diff consumers.
//!
//! ## Badges
//!
//! Badges are SYNTHESIZED at render time from the guide's nested data (the guide
//! pre-computes none): COUPLING / PUBLIC-API / DEPENDENCY from
//! `digest.decisions`, OUT-OF-DIFF from the contract-break lens, OWNER / BUS-FACTOR-1
//! from the unit's routed expert, WEAKENED from `digest.weakening`, INTRODUCED from
//! `digest.deltas`, and VIEWED from the local viewed-state. They are render-only,
//! never a wire field.
