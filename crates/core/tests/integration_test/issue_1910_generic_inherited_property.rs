//! Regression tests for issue #1910: a false positive `unused-class-members`
//! for a method reached through a class field DECLARED ON A BASE CLASS and
//! accessed from a subclass via `this.<field>.<member>()`.
//!
//! Two stacked gaps are covered:
//!  1. non-generic inheritance: `PlainBaseService { client: PlainClient }` +
//!     `PlainDerivedService extends PlainBaseService` calling
//!     `this.client.plainUsed()`;
//!  2. generic-parameter substitution on top: `BaseService<TClient>.client` +
//!     `DerivedService extends BaseService<DerivedClient>` calling
//!     `this.client.getSyntheticRecords()`, where `getSyntheticRecords` lives on
//!     the concrete type argument `DerivedClient`, not the constraint `BaseClient`.
//!
//! Every client also carries a genuinely-dead control member that MUST stay
//! flagged, proving the fix credits precisely through the inheritance chain and
//! never blanket-credits.
