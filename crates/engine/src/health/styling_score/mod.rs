//! Styling-health score: a SECOND health axis derived purely from the structural
//! CSS analytics ([`CssAnalyticsReport`]), orthogonal to the JS/TS code-health
//! score. Mirrors the code-score shape (`vital_signs::compute_health_score`):
//! start at 100, subtract capped per-category penalties, map the result to a
//! letter grade via the shared [`letter_grade`]. The code score is never touched.
//!
//! # Penalty rubric (v3, [`STYLING_HEALTH_FORMULA_VERSION`])
//!
//! The weights below were recalibrated from v1 (v1 -> v2 re-normalized
//! `dead_surface` and `token_erosion`; v2 -> v3 re-weighted the duplication
//! family toward value DRIFT, see below) after running across real projects
//! (government design systems plus small Tailwind apps); any further
//! recalibration bumps [`STYLING_HEALTH_FORMULA_VERSION`] (the same versioning
//! discipline the code score uses). Every category is capped and evaluated
//! against the analytics that are always present once `--css` ran, so there is
//! no "missing pipeline" partial-credit case to model.
//!
//! | Category | Cap | Signal | Scaling |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `duplication` | 20pt | `summary.duplicate_declarations_total` (removable declarations from copy-paste blocks) | `total / max(non_atomic_declarations, 1) * 80`, capped (v3 down-weighted from `* 200`: exact CSS duplication is the least-harmful pattern, so ~25% of declarations removable = full 20pt, a soft hint not a dominant term; the non-atomic denominator is the 3c atomic-exclusion behavior) |
//! | `dead_surface` | 20pt | (a) unused `@theme` tokens, as a share of all defined `@theme` tokens; (b) unreferenced classes + unused at-rules + dead `@font-face`, as a share of `total_declarations` | token term `min(unused_theme_tokens / max(theme_tokens_defined, 1) * 15, 15)` + other term `min(other_dead / max(non_atomic_declarations, 1) * 150, 8)`, summed then capped at 20 (the token term is a *per-population* death ratio so a handful of dead tokens in a declaration-sparse Tailwind project no longer explodes the penalty) |
//! | `broken_references` | 15pt | `unresolved_class_references` + `keyframes_undefined` | `count * 3`, capped (so 5 broken refs = full 15pt) |
//! | `token_erosion` | 10pt | mixed `font-size` units (above 2) + distinct Tailwind arbitrary-value tokens + distinct HARDCODED `box-shadow`/`border-radius`/`line-height` values (v3 sprawl/drift sub-term) | `min((extra_units * 2), 4)` unit term + `min(arbitrary / 18, 8)` arbitrary term + `min(sum_per_axis_excess / 6, 5)` sprawl term (per-axis excess above baselines 10/8/6), summed then capped at 10 |
//! | `structural` | 10pt | `!important` density + deep nesting | `(important_pct - 5).clamp * 1` + `(max_nesting - 4).clamp * 1`, capped |
//!
//! All point values are rounded to one decimal, the final score is clamped to
//! `[0, 100]`, matching the code score's `round1` / clamp behaviour.
//!
//! ## What v1 -> v2 changed, and why
//!
//! - `dead_surface` was normalized by `files_analyzed` in v1, so a 2-stylesheet
//!   Tailwind project with a few dead entities scored far higher than a 32-file
//!   design system with one dead entity. v2 splits the category into two
//!   independently-normalized terms. Unused `@theme` tokens are divided by the
//!   *total number of `@theme` tokens defined* (a per-population death ratio,
//!   threaded in as `theme_tokens_defined`): this is the principled denominator
//!   because Tailwind projects author almost no CSS declarations, so dividing a
//!   few unused tokens by `total_declarations` exploded the penalty (a project
//!   with 4 unused tokens over 24 declarations capped the whole category at 20).
//!   The remaining dead entities (unreferenced classes, unused at-rules, dead
//!   `@font-face`) still divide by `total_declarations`, the size-stable
//!   denominator `duplication` uses, so neither term swings with stylesheet count.
//! - `token_erosion` in v1 added `tailwind_arbitrary_values` raw, so just ~10
//!   distinct arbitrary values maxed the category, punishing ordinary Tailwind
//!   apps. v2 saturates the arbitrary term via a divisor and caps the unit term
//!   so neither sub-signal alone reaches the ceiling.
//!
//! ## What v2 -> v3 changed, and why
//!
//! Research is clear that exact CSS duplication is the LEAST-harmful CSS pattern
//! (repeated declarations gzip away; graphical properties are loosely coupled; CSS
//! has no native abstraction so some repetition is unavoidable), while the real
//! maintenance harm is value DRIFT / inconsistency (the same design intent
//! expressed with divergence: a radius `6px` here and `5px` there; a shadow
//! `rgba(0,0,0,.1)` vs `.12`), which design tokens address. So v3 re-weights the
//! duplication FAMILY toward drift and away from byte-identical repetition:
//!
//! - `duplication` exact-block scale dropped from `* 200` to `* 80` (see
//!   `EXACT_DUP_SCALE`). The notation-canonical exact-block detector is kept
//!   (lightningcss already collapses `0px`/`#fff`/`rgb()`), just down-weighted to
//!   a soft hint. The 20pt cap is unchanged.
//! - `token_erosion` gains a HARDCODED-value-sprawl drift sub-term (see
//!   `value_sprawl_term`) sourced from the previously-descriptive-only
//!   `summary.unique_box_shadows` / `unique_border_radii` / `unique_line_heights`
//!   distinct-value counts. It counts only HARDCODED literals: a system that
//!   tokenizes its scales via `var(--*)` scores 0 (lightningcss parses
//!   `box-shadow: var(--x)` as `Property::Unparsed`, so var-referenced and
//!   `@theme`-defined values never reach the typed-property collectors). Per-axis
//!   baselines (10/8/6) clear every observed real design system; the term
//!   saturates and is sub-capped at 5pt inside the unchanged 10pt category.
//!
//! The original v3 plan (re-canonicalize the duplicate-block fingerprint to detect
//! drift clones) was DROPPED after a Step-0 audit found it a no-op: the css-metrics
//! fingerprint serializes via lightningcss `to_css_string`, which already
//! canonicalizes `0px`/`#fff`/`rgb()`, so it is notation-semantic, not byte-literal.
//! Genuine value drift is surfaced via the un-tokenized-literal sprawl count above.
//!
//! ## Deliberately excluded signals
//!
//! `custom_properties_unreferenced` and `custom_properties_undefined` are
//! intentionally NOT folded into this score. They are false-positive-prone for
//! exactly the projects this axis most needs to grade fairly: a design system
//! exports custom properties that are referenced by *consumers*, not within its
//! own package, so "unreferenced-in-package" is the intended state rather than a
//! smell; and in a cross-package monorepo a property defined in one package and
//! consumed in another reads as "undefined" to a single-package analysis. Both
//! signals stay available in the raw `CssAnalyticsReport` for descriptive
//! surfaces, but they do not move the grade.
//!
//! ## Confidence (descriptive metadata, NOT part of the formula)
//!
//! The grade carries a [`StylingHealthConfidence`] marking it `Low` when the
//! authored-declaration count is below `MIN_CONFIDENT_DECLARATIONS` (with a
//! stated reason), so a grade computed from a thin CSS surface is not presented
//! with the same authority as one from a full design system. Confidence NEVER
//! feeds the score: `score` / `grade` / `penalties` are byte-identical whether it
//! is high or low. The framing is "thin authored-CSS surface", not "unreliable
//! analysis": a utility-first Tailwind project legitimately authors little CSS,
//! so a low mark means the declaration-normalized rubric had little to measure,
//! not that fallow's analysis failed. The EMPTY case (no import-reachable
//! stylesheet, so `css_analytics` and `styling_health` are both `None`) is the
//! strongest form of withholding and is handled one layer up by the human "No
//! stylesheets analyzed" note; this function only ever runs on a non-empty report.
//!
//! ## Calibration (v3, corpus-locked)
//!
//! The v2 weights were validated against a 10-project corpus (3 design systems /
//! SCSS, 4 Tailwind apps, 3 empty / CSS-in-JS); v3 re-ran that corpus plus the 3c
//! atomic CSS-in-JS smoke (Braid / vanilla-extract / StyleX / Panda / emotion) and
//! drift anchors. [`STYLING_HEALTH_FORMULA_VERSION`] bumps 2 -> 3 because rubric
//! constants moved (`EXACT_DUP_SCALE` and the new sprawl sub-term). v3 result, NO
//! band misclassification: every real design system stays A with a 0 sprawl term
//! (utrecht 5 distinct hardcoded shadows < baseline 10; rijkshuisstijl, jsonforms
//! 7 radii < baseline 8, all 0pt sprawl); atomic CSS-in-JS gains no false drift
//! penalty (<= 3 distinct values per axis); a clean token-driven system keeps a 0
//! sprawl term (var-referenced values are uncounted). The sprawl term fires only on
//! genuine hardcoded drift (a 16-distinct-per-axis anchor scores ~4pt). The
//! duplication down-weight moves moderate-dup projects by ~1-2pt (no band flip).
//!
//! Consumer note: a v2 -> v3 bump moves `styling_health.score`/`grade` for some
//! projects, so `--format json` snapshot diffs (including fallow's own golden
//! snapshots) and styling-grade trend dashboards see a one-time step-change at the
//! version boundary; gate on `formula_version`. No exit-code, badge, gate, regression
//! baseline, or trend-snapshot consumes the styling score, so nothing fails; the
//! code `health_score` is byte-unchanged.

///    `@theme` tokens (`theme_tokens_defined`). This per-population death ratio is
///    size-independent. v1 divided unused tokens by `total_declarations`, which
///    exploded for Tailwind projects (they author almost no CSS declarations, so
///    a few unused tokens capped the whole category); normalizing by the token
///    population the tokens are drawn from is the principled fix.
/// 2. **Other-dead term** ([`OTHER_DEAD_SCALE`], capped at
///    [`OTHER_DEAD_TERM_CAP`]): unreferenced classes, unused `@property`/`@layer`
///    at-rules, and dead `@font-face` families as a share of the non-atomic
///    declaration count (the same size-stable denominator the duplication penalty
///    uses). These scale with authored-CSS size, so the declaration denominator is
///    correct for them; only the `@theme` tokens needed the per-population
///    treatment.

/// tokens are EXCLUDED from the other-dead term (they live only in term 1). The
