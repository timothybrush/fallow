/// Cache version, bump when the cache format or cached extraction semantics change.
///
/// Bumped to 89 for issue #475: extraction now strips a leading UTF-8 BOM
/// before hashing and computing line offsets, so pre-fix entries whose source
/// included a BOM carry hashes over the wrong byte sequence and would
/// fast-path into stale `member_accesses` / `exports` for any BOM-bearing
/// file. The bump invalidates user caches once on upgrade; subsequent runs
/// are warm.
///
/// Bumped to 90 for issue #540: CSS Modules class extraction now strips
/// `@layer` and `@import` at-rule preludes before scanning class names, so
/// pre-fix entries for `.module.css` files using nested cascade-layer syntax
/// (`@layer foo.bar { ... }`) carry phantom `bar` / `baz` exports that the
/// new scanner no longer produces.
///
/// Bumped to 91 for issue #549: CSS Modules class extraction now records a
/// real `Span` pointing at each class's declaration position in the source.
/// Pre-fix cache entries for `.module.css` / `.module.scss` files carry
/// `Span::default()` (start=0, end=0) on every export, which renders every
/// finding at line:1 col:0; the new scanner produces real offsets.
///
/// Bumped to 92 for issue #563: feature flag extraction recognizes additional
/// built-in SDK providers (PostHog, Vercel Flags, Optimizely, Eppo, plus more
/// ConfigCat surfaces) and Vercel `flag({ key: "..." })` object arguments, so
/// pre-fix entries can carry stale `flag_uses`.
///
/// Bumped to 93 for issue #589: Node `module.register()` loader calls now
/// emit `DynamicImportInfo.destructured_names` populated with the loader-hook
/// allowlist (current `initialize` / `resolve` / `load` / `globalPreload`
/// plus legacy `getFormat` / `getSource` / `transformSource`) for every
/// relative or `file:` specifier, including specifiers bound via
/// `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`. Pre-fix entries carry empty
/// `destructured_names` for the same source, so they would silently miss
/// the named-export credit until the file is touched.
///
/// Bumped to 94 for issue #586: Playwright helper fixture extraction recognizes
/// helpers with local setup before the final `return base.extend<T>(...)`, so
/// pre-fix entries can miss fixture definition sentinels.
///
/// Bumped to 95 for the Glimmer `<template>` scanner: imported-binding usage
/// and `MemberAccess { object: "this", member }` records for `{{this.foo}}`
/// template references are now folded into the extractor before
/// `into_module_info`. Pre-fix entries for `.gts` / `.gjs` files omit both,
/// so template-only imports surface as `unused-import` and template-only
/// class members as `unused-class-member` until the cache is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 96 for issue #640: generic JSX `<script src>` and
/// `<link rel="stylesheet|modulepreload" href>` attributes no longer emit
/// synthetic `SideEffect` imports, so pre-fix entries can carry stale JSX
/// resource edges that surface as false `unresolved-imports`.
///
/// Bumped to 97 for issue #639: MDX import/export extraction now skips
/// fenced Markdown code blocks, so pre-fix entries can carry stale example
/// imports that surface as false `unresolved-imports`.
///
/// Bumped to 98 for issue #638: statically resolvable `child_process.fork()`
/// targets now emit `DynamicImportInfo` entries for local runner files.
/// Pre-fix entries omit those dynamic imports, so forked script files can be
/// reported as unused until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 99 for issue #605: methods reached via `new Class(...).method()`
/// receivers (direct and fluent-chain) now emit member accesses crediting the
/// constructed class. Pre-fix entries lack those accesses, so such methods can
/// be reported as unused class members until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 100 for issue #608: static Iconify icon strings (`icon="jam:github"`,
/// `name="ic:round-home"`) in markup now populate `iconify_prefixes` so the
/// `@iconify-json/<prefix>` package is credited. Pre-fix entries omit the field,
/// so icon-set packages can be reported as unused until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 101 for issue #704: SFC template tags that match no import now
/// populate `auto_import_candidates` for convention auto-import resolution.
/// Pre-fix entries omit the field, so Nuxt components consumed only via template
/// tags are not edge-credited until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 102 for issue #742: `FunctionComplexity` now carries an
/// `Option<String> source_hash` (content digest of the function's full-span
/// source slice) so runtime-coverage baselines survive line moves. Pre-fix
/// cache entries lack the field, so the hash is absent until re-extraction.
///
/// Bumped to 103 for issue #752: typed destructure bindings
/// (`let { resultState }: Props = $props()`, `function f({ x }: Props)`) now
/// populate `binding_target_names`, which changes the `member_accesses` emitted
/// for those files. Pre-fix cache entries lack the additional member accesses.
///
/// Bumped to 104 for issue #445: MDX, Astro, Vue/Svelte SFC, and CSS/SCSS
/// container extraction now remaps source-authored spans back to the original
/// file byte offsets. Pre-fix entries can carry synthetic extracted-buffer
/// positions, so diagnostics can point at line 1 or compacted MDX lines until
/// the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 105 for issue #739: JS/TS and Vue/Svelte SFC script extraction
/// now populates `auto_import_candidates` from unresolved value references.
/// Pre-fix entries omit these candidates, so convention script auto-imports
/// are not edge-credited until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 106 for `fallow security`: JS/TS extraction now stores file-level
/// directives (`"use client"`, `"use server"`) in the parse cache so client
/// boundary detection does not depend on stale cached module info.
///
/// Bumped to 107 for issue #835: Svelte `<script src>` references no longer
/// emit synthetic imports because they are runtime markup, not bundled SFC
/// script modules. Pre-fix entries can carry stale root-relative imports that
/// surface as false `unresolved-imports`.
///
/// Bumped to 108 for three extraction-semantics changes shipping together:
/// - issue #839: `declare` ambient class properties are no longer extracted as
///   class members (they emit no JS and cannot be value-referenced), so pre-fix
///   entries carry phantom members that surface as false `unused-class-member`.
/// - issue #840: extensionless `new URL(specifier, import.meta.url)` dynamic
///   imports now persist `is_speculative = true` so a directory target
///   (`new URL('./services', import.meta.url)`) is silently dropped when the
///   resolver finds no module; pre-fix entries carry `is_speculative = false`
///   and surface as false `unresolved-imports`.
/// - issue #845: a method call on an `instanceof`-narrowed value now emits a
///   member access against the narrowed class, changing the persisted
///   `member_accesses`; pre-fix entries miss the credit and surface as false
///   `unused-class-member`.
///
/// Bumped to 109 for the data-driven security matcher catalogue: JS/TS
/// extraction now captures non-literal sink sites into `security_sinks`, each
/// carrying an `arg_kind` discriminator (template-with-substitution, concat,
/// object, call, other) so the catalogue can require unsafe SQL shapes and
/// exclude safely-parameterized `` sql`${x}` `` templates and object-form
/// `.execute({ sql, args })` arguments. Pre-109 entries lack the field, so their
/// sink sites do not feed the catalogue until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 110 for issue #844: `const svc = useMemo(() => new Svc())` now
/// binds the non-destructured identifier to the constructed class, so method
/// calls on it emit member accesses crediting the class. This changes the
/// persisted `member_accesses` for files using the useMemo factory shape;
/// pre-fix entries miss the credit and surface as false `unused-class-member`.
///
/// Bumped to 111 for issue #859 (untrusted-source modeling): `SinkSite` now
/// carries `arg_idents` (identifiers referenced in the sink argument) and
/// `ModuleInfo`/`CachedModule` carry `tainted_bindings` (local bindings tied to
/// the member-access path they were sourced from), so the security
/// `tainted_sink` detector can back-trace a sink argument to a known untrusted
/// source. Pre-111 entries lack both, so source-to-sink association is unset
/// until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 112 for issue #863 (sanitizer-aware security sinks):
/// `ModuleInfo`/`CachedModule` now carry direct sanitized sink arguments, so
/// the security `tainted_sink` detector can suppress high-confidence
/// DOMPurify-backed HTML sink candidates. Pre-112 entries lack sanitizer
/// metadata until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 113 for issue #863 follow-up: sanitizer metadata gained URL and
/// path domains plus guarded path backpatching. Pre-113 entries may lack those
/// sanitizer domains until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 114 for issue #911: Angular component properties initialized with
/// named-import `inject(Service)` now populate `ClassHeritageInfo.instance_bindings`
/// so external templates can credit service member access through the property.
/// Pre-114 entries miss the binding and can surface false `unused-class-member`
/// findings until the component file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 115 for issue #910: local typed function calls now credit concrete
/// class members when a direct `new Class()` argument or constructor-bound
/// identifier flows into a structurally typed parameter. Pre-115 entries can
/// miss those synthetic `member_accesses` and surface false
/// `unused-class-member` findings.
///
/// Bumped to 116 for issue #1302: suppression comments and `@expected-unused`
/// tags now carry optional human-authored reasons. Pre-116 entries lack those
/// reasons, so `require-suppression-reason` would report false missing-reason
/// findings until files are re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 117 for issue #955: Vue SFC script-side Nuxt UI icon strings now
/// populate `iconify_icon_names`, allowing declared `@iconify-json/*`
/// collections used through values like `icon: 'i-simple-icons-github'` to be
/// credited. Pre-116 entries omit those names and can surface false
/// `unused-dependency` findings until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 118 for issue #954: JS/TS extraction now records static
/// `pino({ transport: { target: "pkg" } })` target packages as synthetic
/// dynamic imports so runtime transport dependencies are credited. Pre-118
/// entries can surface false `unused-dependency` findings until the file is
/// re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 119 for issue #952: JS/TS extraction now records static package
/// path resolution references so packages consumed via package-root and
/// `pkg/package.json` lookups are credited as dependency usage. Pre-119
/// entries omit those references and can surface false `unused-dependency`
/// findings until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 120 for issue #953: instance methods annotated with TypeScript's
/// `this` return type now count as self-returning for constructor-rooted
/// fluent chains. Pre-120 entries can miss those self-returning flags and
/// surface false `unused-class-member` findings until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 121 for issue #883: framework template HTML injection sinks now
/// flow into `ModuleInfo.security_sinks` for Svelte `{@html ...}`, Vue
/// `v-html`, and Angular `[innerHTML]`. Pre-121 entries omit those sink sites
/// until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 122: `FunctionComplexity` now carries a `contributions` vector
/// (per-decision-point complexity breakdown) and `RequireCallInfo` carries
/// `source_span` (the specifier string-literal span so an `unresolved-import`
/// squiggly anchors under the `'./x'` specifier rather than the `require`
/// keyword). Pre-122 entries lack the breakdown (empty under
/// `health --complexity-breakdown`) and carry `Span::default()` for the
/// require specifier until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 123 for PR #1010: JSDoc import-type extraction now ignores prose
/// examples, including examples that contain ordinary JavaScript brace groups.
/// Pre-123 entries can carry stale type-only imports that surface as false

///
/// Bumped to 124 for issue #877: static `import.meta.env.SECRET` reads now
/// populate `member_accesses` as `import.meta.env` source reads for the
/// opt-in client/server security candidate detector. Pre-124 entries omit the
/// source and would miss Vite env reads until the file is re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 125 for issue #875: `SinkSite` now carries literal argument and
/// object-literal option metadata, allowing security catalogue rows to match
/// deterministic literal sinks such as wildcard postMessage origins,
/// permissive CORS, insecure cookie options, weak crypto algorithms, and
/// alg:none JWT options. Pre-125 entries lack that metadata until the file is
/// re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 126 for issue #876: `SinkSite` now carries flattened source paths
/// referenced inside sink arguments, so source-backed logging candidates can
/// match direct expressions such as `process.env.SECRET` without requiring a
/// temporary local binding. Pre-126 entries lack those paths until the file is
/// re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 127 for issue #898: `SinkSite` now carries complete top-level

///
/// Bumped to 128 for issue #895: JS/TS extraction now captures the exact

/// re-extracted.
///
/// Bumped to 129 for issue #901: JS/TS extraction now captures cleartext

///
/// Bumped to 132 for issue #878: JS/TS extraction now records one-hop

///
/// Bumped to 134 for issue #928: JS/TS extraction now captures risky literal

///
/// Bumped to 135 for issue #929: JS/TS extraction now skips directly clamped

///
/// Bumped to 136 for issue #899: JS/TS extraction now emits GraphQL resolver

///
/// Bumped to 139 for issue #1095: JS/TS extraction now records source-backed

///
/// Bumped to 140 for issue #1094: JS/TS extraction now records declarative

///
/// Bumped to 143 for issue #1138: JS/TS extraction now propagates simple

///
/// Bumped to 144 for issue #1136: JS/TS sanitizer metadata now recognizes

///
/// Bumped to 148 for issue #1190: JS/TS extraction now records nested

///
/// Bumped to 149 for issue #1180: cached inline suppressions now preserve

///
/// Bumped to 151 for the server-only-import security candidate: JS/TS extraction

/// Bumped to 154 for the `unprovided-inject` detector: JS/TS and SFC extraction
/// now record Vue `provide`/`inject` and Svelte `setContext`/`getContext` call
/// sites on `di_key_sites` plus a `has_dynamic_provide` flag, so warm caches
/// written before the bump would report zero unprovided-inject findings.
///
/// Bumped to 155 because `di_key_sites` now drops keys bound to a module-scope
/// string-literal const (string identity, not a symbol), so a warm cache from

///
/// Bumped to 156 because SFC markup asset references (`<img src="./logo.png">`,
/// `<source>`, `<video poster>`) now emit `SideEffect` imports, so a warm cache
/// from 155 would miss the new `unresolved-import` findings on missing assets.
///
/// Bumped to 157 because the Vue `<template>` body extractor now matches the
/// root `</template>` with nesting depth tracking instead of the first
/// `</template>`. A Vue SFC whose root template contains a nested `<template

///
/// Bumped to 158 for the `unused-component-prop` detector: Vue `<script setup>`

///
/// Bumped to 162 for `unused-load-data-key` Primitive A: a destructure off the
/// SvelteKit `data` prop local (`const { user } = data`) now emits `data.<key>`
/// member accesses (rest element records a whole-object use). A warm cache from

/// Bumped to 163 for `unused-load-data-key` Primitive B: a SvelteKit route

///
/// Bumped (origin/main) for the `unused-load-data-key` detector: SvelteKit
/// page-load producers now harvest `load_return_keys` + `has_unharvestable_load`,

///
/// Bumped (origin/main) for the typed-`data` template fix: a SvelteKit route
/// component whose `data` prop is typed (`export let data: PageData`) no longer
/// remaps its template `data.<key>` accesses onto the generated `$types` alias,
/// keeping them keyed on `data` for the load-data join. A warm cache carries the
/// remapped (`PageData.<key>`) accesses and would miss real consumer reads.
///
/// Bumped (origin/main) for #550: CSS Module class extraction now derives its
/// class set from a real CSS AST (lightningcss) for standard CSS, so warm caches
/// written by the regex-only extractor can differ on escaped class names and

///
/// Bumped (feat/react-health) for React/JSX structural extraction (Phase 0
/// foundation): `.jsx`/`.tsx` files now record `component_functions`,
/// `react_props`, `hook_uses`, and `render_edges`, so a warm cache lacks the
/// React IR the later React-health phases consume.
///
/// Bumped (feat/react-health) for the React `unused-component-prop` arm
/// (Phase 1): each `ComponentProp` gained a `component` field (the enclosing
/// React component name) and `react_props[].used_in_script` is now populated
/// from a used-in-body pass, so a warm cache carries props with an empty
/// `component` and always-false usage.
///
/// Bumped (feat/react-health) for React-aware complexity (Phase 2):
/// `FunctionComplexity` now carries `react_hook_count`, `react_jsx_max_depth`,
/// and `react_prop_count` descriptive fields, and the cognitive metric folds
/// deep JSX nesting, hook density, and prop count (recorded as `JsxDepth` /
/// `HookDensity` / `PropCount` contributions). A warm cache carries the pre-fold
/// cognitive scores and lacks the React descriptive counts until re-extraction.
///
/// Bumped (feat/react-health) for the prop-drilling forward signal (Phase 3):
/// `RenderEdge` gained `attr_value_roots` / `has_complex_forward`,
/// `ComponentFunction` gained `uses_clone_element` / `renders_provider` /
/// `has_children_as_function`, and `ComponentProp` gained `used_outside_forward`.
/// A warm cache lacks the per-render attribute-value roots and the

/// consumes.
///
/// Bumped to 170: `ComponentFunction` gained `is_pure_passthrough` (the

///
/// Bumped to 171 (feat/angular): Angular input/output IR
/// (`angular_inputs` / `angular_outputs` on `ModuleInfo`) plus the
/// `unused-component-input` / `unused-component-output` suppression tokens, and
/// the Angular `{ ...this }` spread now records a whole-component abstain marker
/// for the input/output detectors; a warm cache from 170 lacks the Angular IR
/// and the abstain marker and would report zero input/output findings or
/// false-flag spread-forwarded inputs/outputs.
///
/// Bumped to 172 (feat/vue-options-api-prop-emit): the Vue Options API
/// (`export default { props, emits, ... }` / `defineComponent({ ... })`) in a
/// non-setup `<script>` now harvests `component_props` / `component_emits` and
/// the abstain flags the same way `<script setup>` does; a warm cache from 171
/// lacks the Options-API prop/emit IR and would report zero findings on those
/// components.
///
/// Bumped to 173 (feat/svelte-runes-extraction, W1.1): two `.svelte` extraction
/// changes alter serialized module state. (1) Svelte 5's bare `<script module>`
/// attribute is now recognized as module context (was treated as the instance
/// script), so a warm cache wrongly scoped module-level declarations and credited the

/// is now harvested into `component_props` (reusing the Vue IR + abstain flags);
/// a warm cache from 172 lacks the Svelte prop IR. (`<svelte:component>` /
/// `<svelte:element>` / `<svelte:self>` were verified already credited by the

///
/// Bumped to 174 (feat/svelte-dead-event): `.svelte` extraction now records
