For `add-to-config` actions, each fix entry carries a `proposed_diff` field with the unified-diff preview of the proposed config write. When no fallow config exists outside a monorepo subpackage, fix_apply would CREATE `.fallowrc.json` using `fallow init`'s framework-aware scaffolding (`$schema`, `entry`, `ignorePatterns`, etc.) and layer the `ignoreExports` rules on top; preview entries on that path carry `created_files: [\".fallowrc.json\"]`.

Inside a monorepo subpackage (workspace marker `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `package.json#workspaces` / `turbo.json` / `lerna.json` / `rush.json` above the invocation directory) the create-fallback refuses and emits `skip_reason: \"monorepo_subpackage\"` with a relative `workspace_root` path; the agent should re-run `fallow init` at the workspace root or invoke from there.

Unlike the two skips above this is INTENTIONAL: it does NOT change the exit code (the run can still exit 0), and the export stays reported by `fallow dead-code` so it can be confirmed and removed by hand.

It refines the bare `react_hook_count` headline so you can spot effect-soup (many `effect`) and large effect dep-arrays (high `max_effect_dep_arity`) as the actionable triage signals; the breakdown covers component-scope hooks only, so it may sum to LESS than `react_hook_count` when a `use*` call sits in a plain helper. On React/Preact projects `vital_signs` also reports render-fan-in concentration (`p95_render_fan_in`, `render_fan_in_high_pct`, `max_render_fan_in`), the component-graph analogue of module fan-in: where module fan-in counts importing MODULES, render fan-in counts distinct render LOCATIONS of a component (a shared `<Button>` is rendered in far more places than it is imported), surfaced as descriptive blast-radius context (not a gate or finding). The headline `max_render_fan_in` is the highest DISTINCT-PARENTS count (the honest edit-ripple count); test / spec / story / fixture files are excluded. `vital_signs.top_render_fan_in` lists the highest-fan-in components sorted by distinct parents (each with `component` name, project-relative `path`, `distinct_parents` as the headline, and `render_sites` as secondary \"incl. repeats\" context) so you can see WHICH components are the blast-radius hotspots, not just the `max_render_fan_in` number. Set coverage_gaps=true to explicitly include static test coverage gaps: runtime files and exports with no test dependency path (not line-level coverage). A provided config file may also enable coverage gaps via rules.coverage-gaps when no health sections are explicitly selected. Set hotspots=true to identify files that are both complex and frequently changing (combines git churn with complexity). Set churn_file to a `fallow-churn/v1` JSON path to power the churn-backed signals (hotspots, ownership, and refactoring targets) from imported VCS history instead of git, so they work on projects with no git repository (Yandex Arc, Mercurial, Perforce); a small wrapper translates the VCS log into the contract, and the `since` window then only labels output since the file is authoritative. Set ownership=true (implies hotspots) to attach per-file ownership signals: bus factor, contributor count, declared CODEOWNERS owner, ownership_state, drift, and unowned-hotspot flag. Use ownership_email_mode=raw|handle|anonymized|hash for author email privacy (default handle; hash is the legacy spelling for anonymized output). Set targets=true for ranked refactoring recommendations sorted by efficiency (quick wins first), with confidence scores and adaptive percentile-based thresholds. Set trend=true to compare current metrics against the most recent saved snapshot and show per-metric deltas with directional indicators (improving/declining/stable). Implies --score. Requires prior snapshots saved with save_snapshot. Set effort to control analysis depth: 'low' (fast, surface-level), 'medium' (balanced, default), or 'high' (thorough, all heuristics). Set summary=true to include a natural-language summary of findings alongside the structured JSON. Set coverage to a path to Istanbul-format coverage data (coverage-final.json from Jest, Vitest, c8, nyc) for accurate per-function CRAP scores instead of the default static binary model. CRAP findings carry a `coverage_source` discriminator (`istanbul`, `estimated`, or `estimated_component_inherited`); `summary.coverage_source_consistency` and grouped `coverage_source_consistency` report whether emitted CRAP finding sources are uniform or mixed; synthetic `<template>` findings on Angular `.html` files use `estimated_component_inherited` and include an `inherited_from` path to the owning `.component.ts` so agents target the component file for coverage remediation rather than the template. Angular components whose class AND template both contribute to complexity also emit a synthetic `<component>` rollup finding anchored at the worst class method's `(line, col)`. The rollup's `cyclomatic` is `worst_class_method.cyclomatic + template.cyclomatic` (the same worst-by-cyclomatic method drives both metrics; cognitive is `worst.cognitive + template.cognitive`). The `component_rollup` payload carries the pre-summation breakdown: `class_worst_function` (method name), `class_cyclomatic` / `class_cognitive` (per-method numbers), `template_path` / `template_cyclomatic` / `template_cognitive`, plus a `component` identifier derived from the .ts owner's file stem. The rollup's `suppress-line` action uses `placement: \"above-component-worst-method\"`: a `// fallow-ignore-next-line complexity` placed above the worst class method hides BOTH the per-function finding AND the rollup, so agents do not need to emit two suppression edits. Per-function and per-`<template>` entries stay alongside the rollup; ranking and `--targets` use the rollup so a template-heavy component surfaces as one unit rather than scattered medium findings. Set runtime_coverage to a path (V8 coverage directory, V8 JSON file, or Istanbul JSON file) for merged runtime-coverage findings (a single local capture is free; continuous or multi-capture runtime monitoring requires an active license via `fallow license activate`). Runtime-coverage tuning: set min_invocations_hot=N to tune the hot-path threshold (default 100), min_observation_volume=N to tune the high-confidence verdict floor (default 5000), and low_traffic_threshold=RATIO to tune the active/low-traffic split (default 0.001). Set group_by to \"owner\" (CODEOWNERS), \"directory\", \"package\" (workspace), or \"section\" (GitLab CODEOWNERS `[Section]` headers, with `owners` metadata per group) to partition results. Each group gets its own `vital_signs`, `health_score`, `findings`, `file_scores`, `hotspots`, `large_functions`, and `targets` recomputed against the group's files (top-level metrics stay project-wide). Use this to answer per-team or per-package quality questions like \"which workspace has the worst maintainability?\" without running fallow once per package. When config health.thresholdOverrides is set, health findings use the resolved local thresholds and JSON includes threshold_overrides state so agents can see active, stale, and full-run no-match exceptions. Supports config, baseline comparisons, and performance tuning (no_cache, threads). Useful for identifying hard-to-maintain code and prioritizing refactoring.",

Set gate=\"all\" or audit.gate=\"all\" in config to gate every finding. Returns JSON with verdict, summary counts per category, attribution counts, and full issue details with actions array for auto-correction. Set coverage to an Istanbul coverage-final.json path and coverage_root to an absolute coverage-data path prefix when paths need rebasing for accurate CRAP scoring in the health sub-analysis. Audit health JSON includes `coverage_source` on CRAP findings and `summary.coverage_source_consistency` when emitted CRAP source data is uniform or mixed.

Set include_entry_exports=true to also report unused exports in entry files (catches typos in framework exports like `meatdata` vs `metadata`); the CLI flag ORs with the `includeEntryExports` config value. Set runtime_coverage to a V8 coverage directory, V8 JSON file, or Istanbul coverage-final.json to fold runtime-coverage findings into the same audit invocation: agents get the `hot-path-touched` verdict alongside dead-code and complexity in one call (a single local capture is free, continuous or multi-capture monitoring requires an active license; informational verdict, no exit-code change). Set min_invocations_hot=N to tune the runtime-coverage hot-path threshold used by audit (default 100).

When both `FALLOW_DIFF_FILE` and `FALLOW_CHANGED_SINCE` are set, the diff wins for line-level filtering and `--changed-since` still scopes file discovery.
