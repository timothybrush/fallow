# Analyzer Authoring Guide

This guide is for contributors adding a new built-in finding, analyzer, or
framework-specific rule.

## Start With The Contract

Before choosing a crate or protocol surface, read
[`architecture-invariants.md`](architecture-invariants.md). It lists the
allowed dependency directions, IO boundaries, serialization boundaries, and
current migration exceptions. New analyzer work should fit those boundaries or
call out the exception before implementation.

Pick the public identity before writing detection code:

- `rule_id`: the stable output rule id, usually `fallow/<code>`.
- `code`: the stable issue code in JSON, SARIF, LSP diagnostics, and suppressions.
- `rules` key: the config key users set to `error`, `warn`, or `off`.
- suppression token: the token after `// fallow-ignore-next-line` or `// fallow-ignore-file`.
- filter flag: only when `fallow dead-code` needs a dedicated selector.
- result key: the `AnalysisResults` array that carries the finding in JSON, if any.
- count policy: whether that result key contributes to `total_issues()`.
- docs anchor: where `fallow explain` and output formats should point users.

Common contract facts live in `crates/types/src/issue_meta.rs`. Add the row
there first when the finding has a stable issue code, LSP diagnostic code,
filter flag, or suppression token. Keep prose and caveats in the surface that
owns them.

The generated contract surfaces are tracked in `scripts/contract-surfaces.mjs`.
Check that manifest before adding or renaming any schema, issue registry,
editor type, NAPI type, or agent-doc artifact. The manifest is also checked
against `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so the CI drift gate runs when a generated
surface changes.

## Optional Scaffold

To start from a checklist-only plan:

```bash
npm run scaffold:analyzer -- unused-example
```

The command writes `.plans/analyzers/unused-example.md` and does not edit Rust
source.

## Implementation Checklist

Use this as the default map for a new finding:

- `crates/types/src/suppress.rs`: add an `IssueKind` only when the finding is suppressible or must persist in cache-facing data.
- `crates/types/src/issue_meta.rs`: add shared code, aliases, labels, config key, filter flag, result key, count policy, MCP selector, suppression token, and LSP exposure.
- `crates/config/src/config/rules.rs`: add the rule severity field, aliases, defaults, and unknown-key suggestions.
- `crates/cli/src/explain.rs`: add the `RuleDef`, docs path, guide text, and aliases for `fallow explain`.
- Analyzer code: keep extraction, graph facts, and reporting changes in the narrowest crate that already owns that stage.
- Output formats: verify human, JSON, SARIF, Code Climate, compact, markdown, GitHub, and GitLab consumers when the finding is user visible.
- Total counts: if a new serialized `AnalysisResults` array contributes to `total_issues()`, add it to `TOTAL_ISSUE_RESULT_KEYS` and set the metadata row's `counts_in_total`. If the array is advisory, keep `counts_in_total` false so schema consumers know not to gate PR summary surfaces on it.
- Actions: add suppress, fix, trace, or config actions when agents can act on the finding safely.
- LSP and MCP: prefer the shared metadata row for contract facts. Keep editor and agent guidance hand-written where nuance matters.
- Contract bundle: run `npm run generate:contracts` after changing schema, output, issue registry, CLI capability, TS type, NAPI type, agent-doc surfaces, or the contract surface manifest.
- Docs: update this guide or `docs/plugin-authoring.md` when the workflow changes.

## Detection Shape

Prefer the smallest fact that makes the finding correct:

- Single-file facts stay in extraction or the file-local analyzer.
- Cross-file facts should flow through the module graph or a dedicated analysis pass.
- Framework features should abstain when the framework is absent or the config cannot be resolved confidently.
- Opt-in or warning defaults are appropriate when the public API is open-ended or reflective.
- File-level suppressions fit findings where one source file represents a whole group. Line-level suppressions fit one declaration or usage.

Do not add a new broad abstraction just to group fields by topic. A split is
worth it when it encodes lifecycle or optionality, for example when a plain
JavaScript module structurally cannot carry SFC-only facts.

## Fixture Matrix

Each new analyzer should add fixtures that state what behavior they prove. The
test name or fixture comment should make the proof obvious without reading the
implementation.

| Fixture kind | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| Positive minimal | The finding appears for the smallest real shape. |
| Negative abstain | The analyzer stays silent when the framework, config, or semantic precondition is missing. |
| False-positive guard | A common nearby pattern does not report. |
| Suppression | The intended line-level or file-level suppression is consumed. |
| Filter and severity | The rule key, CLI filter, and severity gate select the finding correctly. |
| Output contract | JSON actions, SARIF rule id, compact text, and human docs links stay stable. |
| Framework regression | A distilled real-world pattern from a supported framework keeps working. |

Recommended fixture row format for docs, tests, or review notes:

| Analyzer | Fixture | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unused-store-member` | `tests/fixtures/pinia-*` | Reports unused Pinia members while reachable store modules stay live. |
| `unused-load-data-key` | `tests/fixtures/sveltekit-*`, `tests/fixtures/react-router-loader-data`, `tests/fixtures/remix-loader-data`, `tests/fixtures/route-loader-data-no-dep` | Reports unused SvelteKit, React Router, and Remix loader data keys while keeping visible data reads live. |
| `invalid-client-export` | `tests/fixtures/invalid-client-export-no-next` | Abstains outside Next.js. |
| `security-sink` | `tests/fixtures/security-*` | Keeps security categories gated by configured matcher and category rules. |

Keep synthetic fixtures small, but include at least one distilled framework
regression when the rule depends on framework conventions.

## Regeneration

After touching schema, generated types, config schemas, plugin schemas, rule-pack
schemas, issue registry metadata, CLI capability metadata, NAPI types, or
agent-facing docs, run:

```bash
npm run generate:contracts
```

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
npm run generate:contracts:check
```

The check command fails on drift without rewriting committed files. It verifies
the full generated contract bundle: config/plugin/rule-pack schemas, output
schema, npm `schema.json`, npm `capabilities.json`, npm `issue-registry.json`,
TS output contracts, NAPI types, agent-facing docs, and CI path-filter coverage
for every generated path listed in `scripts/contract-surfaces.mjs`.

For a faster CI path-filter check while editing generated surfaces, run:

```bash
npm run check:contract-surfaces
```

If this fails, either add the new generated path to the manifest or add the
manifested path to the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` filter that runs the contract
drift gate. Do not rely on the checklist alone.

When changing workspace crate dependencies, also run:

```bash
npm run check:crate-boundaries
```

This catches the clearest architecture back-edges, such as foundation crates
depending on protocol adapters or `fallow-output` starting analysis.
